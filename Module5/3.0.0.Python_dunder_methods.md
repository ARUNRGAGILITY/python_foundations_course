# Python Dunder Methods __dunder__ 

In Python, "dunder" methods, short for "double underscore" methods, are a set of predefined methods that you can use to enrich your classes. They are also known as magic methods or special methods. These methods are identified by their double underscore (`__`) prefix and suffix, such as `__init__` or `__str__`. Dunder methods allow you to emulate the behavior of built-in types or to implement operator overloading.

### Common Dunder Methods

1. **`__init__(self, [...])`**
   - The constructor of the class. It's called when an object is created.
   - Example:
     ```python
     class Example:
         def __init__(self, value):
             self.value = value
     ```

2. **`__str__(self)`**
   - Returns a human-readable string representation of the object.
   - Example:
     ```python
     class Example:
         def __str__(self):
             return "Human-readable representation"
     ```

3. **`__repr__(self)`**
   - Returns an unambiguous string representation of the object which can be used to reproduce the object.
   - Example:
     ```python
     class Example:
         def __repr__(self):
             return "Example()"
     ```

4. **`__len__(self)`**
   - Returns the length of the container. Called by the `len()` built-in function.
   - Example:
     ```python
     class Example:
         def __len__(self):
             return 10  # Example length
     ```

5. **`__getitem__(self, key)`**
   - Used to access items using the subscript syntax (`obj[key]`).
   - Example:
     ```python
     class Example:
         def __getitem__(self, key):
             return "value for key"
     ```

6. **`__setitem__(self, key, value)`**
   - Used to assign a value to an item using the subscript syntax.
   - Example:
     ```python
     class Example:
         def __setitem__(self, key, value):
             pass  # Set the item
     ```

7. **`__delitem__(self, key)`**
   - Used to delete an item using the subscript syntax.
   - Example:
     ```python
     class Example:
         def __delitem__(self, key):
             pass  # Delete the item
     ```

8. **`__iter__(self)`**
   - Returns an iterator for the container. This method is called when an iterator is required, such as in a loop.
   - Example:
     ```python
     class Example:
         def __iter__(self):
             return iter([1, 2, 3])
     ```

9. **`__next__(self)`**
   - Used to get the next item in an iteration.
   - Example:
     ```python
     class Example:
         def __next__(self):
             return 1  # Return the next item
     ```

10. **`__add__(self, other)`**, **`__sub__(self, other)`**, **`__mul__(self, other)`**, etc.
    - Implement arithmetic operations. These are called for addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and so forth.
    - Example:
      ```python
      class Example:
          def __add__(self, other):
              return Example()  # Return a new object
      ```

11. **`__eq__(self, other)`**, **`__lt__(self, other)`**, **`__gt__(self, other)`**, etc.
    - Used for comparison operations (`==`, `<`, `>`, etc.).
    - Example:
      ```python
      class Example:
          def __eq__(self, other):
              return True  # Implement comparison
      ```

### Best Practices

- Implementing these methods can greatly enhance the usability and integration of your objects.
- Only implement the dunder methods that make sense for your class. Not every class needs to be comparable, iterable, or usable as a context manager.
- Remember that these methods should generally return new objects rather than modifying the existing ones, especially for immutable types.

Dunder methods are a powerful feature of Python that allows your objects to behave like built-in types, making your classes more intuitive to use and integrate well with the language's features.
