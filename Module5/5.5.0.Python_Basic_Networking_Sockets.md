# Python Basic Networking Sockets

Python provides powerful libraries for networking tasks, including creating client and server applications, making HTTP requests, and working with sockets. Here are examples of Python networking tasks:

### 1. Creating a TCP Server and Client with Sockets:

You can create a simple TCP server and client using the `socket` module. Here's an example:

#### Server:

```python
import socket

# Create a socket object
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Bind the server to a specific host and port
server_address = ('localhost', 12345)
server_socket.bind(server_address)

# Listen for incoming connections
server_socket.listen(5)

print("Server is listening...")

while True:
    # Accept a connection from a client
    client_socket, client_address = server_socket.accept()
    print(f"Accepted connection from {client_address}")

    # Send data to the client
    message = "Hello, client!"
    client_socket.send(message.encode())

    # Receive data from the client
    data = client_socket.recv(1024)
    print(f"Received: {data.decode()}")

    # Close the client socket
    client_socket.close()
```

#### Client:

```python
import socket

# Create a socket object
client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Connect to the server
server_address = ('localhost', 12345)
client_socket.connect(server_address)

# Send data to the server
message = "Hello, server!"
client_socket.send(message.encode())

# Receive data from the server
data = client_socket.recv(1024)
print(f"Received: {data.decode()}")

# Close the client socket
client_socket.close()
```

### 2. Making HTTP Requests:

Python provides the `requests` library for making HTTP requests to web servers. Here's an example of making a GET request:

```python
import requests

# Make a GET request
response = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print("Response:")
    print(data)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
```

### 3. Creating a Simple HTTP Server:

You can create a simple HTTP server using Python's built-in `http.server` module. Here's an example:

```python
import http.server
import socketserver

# Define the port
port = 8080

# Create a simple HTTP server
handler = http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
httpd = socketserver.TCPServer(("", port), handler)

print(f"Serving at port {port}")
httpd.serve_forever()
```

These examples cover basic networking tasks in Python, including creating TCP servers and clients, making HTTP requests, and creating simple HTTP servers.
