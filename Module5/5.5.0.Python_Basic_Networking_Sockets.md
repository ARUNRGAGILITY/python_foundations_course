# Python Basic Networking Sockets

Python provides powerful libraries for networking tasks, including creating client and server applications, making HTTP requests, and working with sockets. Here are examples of Python networking tasks:

### 1. Creating a TCP Server and Client with Sockets:

You can create a simple TCP server and client using the `socket` module. Here's an example:

#### Server:

```python
import socket

# Create a socket object
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Bind the server to a specific host and port
server_address = ('localhost', 12345)
server_socket.bind(server_address)

# Listen for incoming connections
server_socket.listen(5)

print("Server is listening...")

while True:
    # Accept a connection from a client
    client_socket, client_address = server_socket.accept()
    print(f"Accepted connection from {client_address}")

    # Send data to the client
    message = "Hello, client!"
    client_socket.send(message.encode())

    # Receive data from the client
    data = client_socket.recv(1024)
    print(f"Received: {data.decode()}")

    # Close the client socket
    client_socket.close()
```

#### Client:

```python
import socket

# Create a socket object
client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Connect to the server
server_address = ('localhost', 12345)
client_socket.connect(server_address)

# Send data to the server
message = "Hello, server!"
client_socket.send(message.encode())

# Receive data from the server
data = client_socket.recv(1024)
print(f"Received: {data.decode()}")

# Close the client socket
client_socket.close()
```

### 2. Making HTTP Requests:

Python provides the `requests` library for making HTTP requests to web servers. Here's an example of making a GET request:

```python
import requests

# Make a GET request
response = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print("Response:")
    print(data)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
```

### 3. Creating a Simple HTTP Server:

You can create a simple HTTP server using Python's built-in `http.server` module. Here's an example:

```python
import http.server
import socketserver

# Define the port
port = 8080

# Create a simple HTTP server
handler = http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
httpd = socketserver.TCPServer(("", port), handler)

print(f"Serving at port {port}")
httpd.serve_forever()
```

These examples cover basic networking tasks in Python, including creating TCP servers and clients, making HTTP requests, and creating simple HTTP servers. 

# Python Simple Socket Project 

This is a small project that demonstrates a basic chat application using sockets in Python. This project consists of a server and multiple clients that can exchange messages with each other. You can run multiple instances of the client to simulate a chat among users.

**Chat Server:**

```python
import socket
import threading

# Create a socket for the server
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Bind the server to a specific host and port
server_address = ('localhost', 12345)
server_socket.bind(server_address)

# Listen for incoming connections
server_socket.listen(5)

# List to store connected clients
clients = []

# Function to broadcast messages to all clients
def broadcast(message, client_socket):
    for client in clients:
        if client != client_socket:
            try:
                client.send(message)
            except:
                # Remove the client if unable to send message
                remove(client)

# Function to remove a client from the list
def remove(client_socket):
    if client_socket in clients:
        clients.remove(client_socket)

# Function to handle each client
def handle_client(client_socket):
    while True:
        try:
            message = client_socket.recv(1024)
            if message:
                print(f"Received: {message.decode()}")
                broadcast(message, client_socket)
            else:
                remove(client_socket)
        except:
            continue

# Accept and handle incoming connections
print("Chat server is running...")

while True:
    client_socket, client_address = server_socket.accept()
    clients.append(client_socket)
    print(f"Connected to {client_address}")
    client_socket.send("Welcome to the chat room!".encode())

    # Create a thread to handle the client
    client_thread = threading.Thread(target=handle_client, args=(client_socket,))
    client_thread.start()
```

**Chat Client:**

```python
import socket
import threading

# Create a socket for the client
client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Connect to the server
server_address = ('localhost', 12345)
client_socket.connect(server_address)

# Function to send messages to the server
def send_message():
    while True:
        message = input()
        client_socket.send(message.encode())

# Function to receive messages from the server
def receive_message():
    while True:
        try:
            message = client_socket.recv(1024)
            print(message.decode())
        except:
            print("Connection to the server is lost.")
            client_socket.close()
            break

# Create threads for sending and receiving messages
send_thread = threading.Thread(target=send_message)
receive_thread = threading.Thread(target=receive_message)

# Start the threads
send_thread.start()
receive_thread.start()
```

To run this project:

1. Save the server code in one file (e.g., `chat_server.py`) and the client code in another file (e.g., `chat_client.py`).

2. Run the server by executing `python chat_server.py` in one terminal.

3. Run multiple clients in separate terminals by executing `python chat_client.py`.

You can chat among different client instances connected to the server. This project demonstrates a simple text-based chat application using sockets in Python.
