# Python Excel Read/write

Here's an overview of a Python project that reads, modifies, and saves data from an Excel sheet. 
We'll use the `pandas` library for data manipulation and the `openpyxl` library for working with Excel files. 
Sample data has been provided.

### Project Overview:

**Objective:** Create a Python script that reads an Excel file, performs modifications on the data, and saves the modified data back to the Excel file.

**Libraries Used:**
- `pandas` for data manipulation.
- `openpyxl` for working with Excel files.

### Sample Data:

Let's assume we have an Excel file named `sample_data.xlsx` with the following data:

| Name     | Age | Country |
|----------|-----|---------|
| Alice    | 25  | USA     |
| Bob      | 30  | Canada  |
| Charlie  | 22  | UK      |

### Project Steps:

1. **Read Data:**
   - Read the data from the Excel file into a pandas DataFrame.

2. **Modify Data:**
   - Perform modifications on the data. For example, let's add 5 to the ages.

3. **Save Data:**
   - Save the modified data back to the Excel file.

### Sample Code:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read data from the Excel file
file_path = 'sample_data.xlsx'
df = pd.read_excel(file_path)

# Modify the data (e.g., add 5 to ages)
df['Age'] = df['Age'] + 5

# Save the modified data back to the Excel file
df.to_excel(file_path, index=False, engine='openpyxl')

print("Data has been modified and saved successfully.")
```

### Resulting Excel Data:

After running the script, the Excel file (`sample_data.xlsx`) will be updated with the modified data:

| Name     | Age | Country |
|----------|-----|---------|
| Alice    | 30  | USA     |
| Bob      | 35  | Canada  |
| Charlie  | 27  | UK      |

This project demonstrates a basic example of reading, modifying, and saving data from an Excel sheet using Python and the `pandas` library. You can customize the modifications and the Excel file as per your specific use case.
