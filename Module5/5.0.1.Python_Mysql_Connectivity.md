# Python Mysql Connectivity
In this module/part, we will see how to connect to a MySQL database in Python using the `mysql-connector` library and perform basic operations like adding, modifying, updating, and deleting records/fields:

### Prerequisites:

Before running this code, make sure you have the `mysql-connector-python` library installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python
```

### Python MySQL Database Connectivity Example:

```python
import mysql.connector

# Connect to the MySQL database
conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="your_host",
    user="your_username",
    password="your_password",
    database="your_database"
)

# Create a cursor object to interact with the database
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Function to create a table if it doesn't exist
def create_table():
    cursor.execute("""
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students (
        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(255),
        age INT
    )
    """)

# Function to add a new record
def add_student(name, age):
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO students (name, age) VALUES (%s, %s)", (name, age))
    conn.commit()
    print("Record added successfully!")

# Function to modify a record
def modify_student_name(student_id, new_name):
    cursor.execute("UPDATE students SET name = %s WHERE id = %s", (new_name, student_id))
    conn.commit()
    print("Record modified successfully!")

# Function to update a record
def update_student_age(student_id, new_age):
    cursor.execute("UPDATE students SET age = %s WHERE id = %s", (new_age, student_id))
    conn.commit()
    print("Record updated successfully!")

# Function to delete a record
def delete_student(student_id):
    cursor.execute("DELETE FROM students WHERE id = %s", (student_id,))
    conn.commit()
    print("Record deleted successfully!")

# Create the table (call it only once)
create_table()

# Add records
add_student("Alice", 25)
add_student("Bob", 30)
add_student("Charlie", 22)

# Modify a record
modify_student_name(2, "Bobby")

# Update a record
update_student_age(3, 23)

# Delete a record
delete_student(1)

# Fetch and display all records
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM students")
records = cursor.fetchall()
for record in records:
    print(record)

# Close the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
conn.close()
```

In this example, we first establish a connection to the MySQL database, create a table (if it doesn't exist), and then perform operations to add, modify, update, and delete records/fields in the `students` table. Finally, we fetch and display all the records from the table.

Make sure to replace `"your_host"`, `"your_username"`, `"your_password"`, and `"your_database"` with your MySQL server details.
