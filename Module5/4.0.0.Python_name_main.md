# Python __name__ and __main__ 

In Python, `__name__` is a special built-in variable which is set to the name of the module in which it is used. However, when the module is run as the main program, `__name__` is set to the string `'__main__'`. This behavior is useful for deciding whether a script needs to run some code only when it is executed as a standalone program or when it is imported as a module in another script.

### Purpose

1. **Differentiating Between Import and Direct Execution**: Helps the code to determine if it's being run as a standalone script or if it's being imported and used as a module in another script.

2. **Writing Code for Testing and Debugging**: Often used to write test code in the same script that can be executed when the script is run standalone.

3. **Organizing Code**: Allows for a cleaner organization of code, separating the executable part of the script from the definitions such as functions and classes.

### Usage

When a Python file is run, Python sets the `__name__` variable in that file to `'__main__'`. When the same file is imported into another file, `__name__` is set to the file's name.

### Examples

1. **Basic Example**:
   ```python
   def function():
       print("Function called")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       function()  # This will run if the script is executed directly.
   ```

   In this example, `function()` will only be called if the script is executed directly. If this script is imported as a module in another script, `function()` will not be called.

2. **Script with Testing Code**:
   ```python
   def add(a, b):
       return a + b

   def test_add():
       assert add(2, 3) == 5
       print("Test passed!")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       test_add()  # Test code runs only when executed directly.
   ```

   Here, `test_add()` is a function containing test code for `add()`. This test runs only when the script is the main program.

3. **Module and Script in One**:
   Suppose you have two files, `module.py` and `main.py`. `module.py` contains:

   ```python
   def hello():
       print("Hello, world!")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       print("This message appears only when module.py is executed directly.")
   ```

   `main.py` contains:
   ```python
   import module

   module.hello()  # Prints "Hello, world!"
   ```

   When you run `module.py`, it prints the message inside the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block. When `module.py` is imported and used in `main.py`, it doesn't print that message but allows the use of the `hello()` function.

Using `if __name__ == "__main__":` allows your Python files to be both reusable modules and standalone programs, depending on how they are used. This makes it a very useful feature for writing versatile and neatly organized code.
