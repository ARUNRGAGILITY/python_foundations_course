# Python Operators
Python provides a variety of operators that can be classified into several categories. Each category serves a different purpose and operates on data in specific ways. Here are the seven types of operators in Python, explained in detail:

### 1. Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

- `+`: Addition (e.g., `a + b`)
- `-`: Subtraction (e.g., `a - b`)
- `*`: Multiplication (e.g., `a * b`)
- `/`: Division (e.g., `a / b`)
- `%`: Modulus (e.g., `a % b` returns the remainder of division)
- `**`: Exponentiation (e.g., `a ** b` is `a` raised to the power of `b`)
- `//`: Floor division (e.g., `a // b` performs division and rounds down to the nearest integer)

### 2. Comparison (Relational) Operators
Comparison operators compare values and return `True` or `False` based on the validity of the condition.

- `==`: Equal to (e.g., `a == b`)
- `!=`: Not equal to (e.g., `a != b`)
- `>`: Greater than (e.g., `a > b`)
- `<`: Less than (e.g., `a < b`)
- `>=`: Greater than or equal to (e.g., `a >= b`)
- `<=`: Less than or equal to (e.g., `a <= b`)

### 3. Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.

- `and`: Returns `True` if both statements are true (e.g., `a and b`)
- `or`: Returns `True` if one of the statements is true (e.g., `a or b`)
- `not`: Reverse the result, returns `False` if the result is true (e.g., `not a`)

### 4. Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

- `=`: Assigns a value (e.g., `a = 5`)
- `+=`: Adds and then assigns (e.g., `a += 3` is equivalent to `a = a + 3`)
- `-=`: Subtracts and then assigns (e.g., `a -= 3`)
- `*=`: Multiplies and then assigns (e.g., `a *= 3`)
- `/=`: Divides and then assigns (e.g., `a /= 3`)
- `%=`: Takes modulus and then assigns (e.g., `a %= 3`)
- `**=`: Exponentiates and then assigns (e.g., `a **= 3`)
- `//=`: Performs floor division and then assigns (e.g., `a //= 3`)
- There are more assignment operators related to bitwise operations as well.

### 5. Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators act on bits and perform bit-by-bit operations.

- `&`: Bitwise AND (e.g., `a & b`)
- `|`: Bitwise OR (e.g., `a | b`)
- `^`: Bitwise XOR (e.g., `a ^ b`)
- `~`: Bitwise NOT (e.g., `~a`)
- `<<`: Bitwise left shift (e.g., `a << 1`)
- `>>`: Bitwise right shift (e.g., `a >> 1`)

### 6. Identity Operators
Identity operators compare the memory locations of two objects.

- `is`: Returns `True` if both variables are the same object (e.g., `a is b`)
- `is not`: Returns `True` if both variables are not the same object (e.g., `a is not b`)

### 7. Membership Operators
Membership operators test if a sequence is presented in an object.

- `in`: Returns `True` if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object (e.g., `a in list`)
- `not in`: Returns `True` if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object (e.g., `a not in list`)

Each type of operator plays a crucial role in Python programming, allowing for the creation of complex expressions and the manipulation of data in various ways.
### 8. Walrus Operator
In addition to the seven main types of operators (Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical, Assignment, Bitwise, Identity, and Membership operators), Python also includes a special category known as the **Walrus Operator** as of Python 3.8. This operator is somewhat less commonly used but can be very handy in certain situations.

### Walrus Operator (`:=`)
The Walrus operator, introduced in Python 3.8, is an assignment expression operator. It assigns values to variables as part of an expression.

#### Key Features:
1. **Inline Assignments**: It allows you to assign values to variables within an expression, including conditions in loops and comprehensions.
2. **Improves Readability**: Can make some parts of the code more readable by eliminating the need for an assignment statement before the expression.
3. **Efficiency**: It can be more efficient in some cases as it avoids re-evaluating an expression.

#### Example Usage:

1. **In a While Loop**:
   ```python
   # Without Walrus Operator
   input_str = input("Enter something: ")
   while input_str != "quit":
       print("You entered:", input_str)
       input_str = input("Enter something: ")

   # With Walrus Operator
   while (input_str := input("Enter something: ")) != "quit":
       print("You entered:", input_str)
   ```

2. **In List Comprehensions**:
   ```python
   # Finding lengths of words using the Walrus operator
   words = ["hello", "world", "python", "programming"]
   lengths = [(word, len_word) for word in words if (len_word := len(word)) > 6]
   ```

In these examples, the Walrus operator `:=` allows you to assign values to variables within the expression, making the code more concise and often more readable. However, it's important to use this operator judiciously, as overuse or misuse can lead to less readable code.

# Python Operator Examples

Python Operators
1. Arithmetic
2. Assignment
3. Logical
4. Membership
5. Identity
6. Bitwise
7. Walrus
8. Relational (Comparison)

### 1. Arithmetic Operators
Perform mathematical operations.

```python
# Addition
print(5 + 3)  # Output: 8

# Subtraction
print(5 - 3)  # Output: 2

# Multiplication
print(5 * 3)  # Output: 15

# Division
print(5 / 2)  # Output: 2.5

# Modulus (remainder)
print(5 % 2)  # Output: 1

# Exponentiation
print(2 ** 3)  # Output: 8

# Floor Division
print(5 // 2)  # Output: 2
```

### 2. Comparison Operators
Compare values and return a Boolean.

```python
a, b = 5, 3

# Equal to
print(a == b)  # Output: False

# Not equal to
print(a != b)  # Output: True

# Greater than
print(a > b)  # Output: True

# Less than
print(a < b)  # Output: False

# Greater than or equal to
print(a >= b)  # Output: True

# Less than or equal to
print(a <= b)  # Output: False
```

### 3. Logical Operators
Combine conditional statements.

```python
x = True
y = False

# and
print(x and y)  # Output: False

# or
print(x or y)  # Output: True

# not
print(not x)  # Output: False
```

### 4. Assignment Operators
Assign or modify values.

```python
a = 5  # Assignment

a += 2  # Add and assign
print(a)  # Output: 7

a -= 2  # Subtract and assign
print(a)  # Output: 5

a *= 2  # Multiply and assign
print(a)  # Output: 10

a /= 2  # Divide and assign
print(a)  # Output: 5.0
```

### `%=`: Modulus and Assign
```python
a = 16
a %= 7  # Equivalent to a = a % 7
print(a)  # Output: 2
```
This calculates the remainder of `a` divided by 7 and assigns it back to `a`.

### `**=`: Exponentiate and Assign
```python
a = 2
a **= 3  # Equivalent to a = a ** 3
print(a)  # Output: 8
```
This raises `a` to the power of 3 and assigns the result back to `a`.

### `//=`: Floor Division and Assign
```python
a = 7
a //= 2  # Equivalent to a = a // 2
print(a)  # Output: 3
```
This performs floor division on `a` by 2 and assigns the result back to `a`. Floor division divides the number and rounds down to the nearest integer.

These compound assignment operators are shorthand and make the code more concise, especially in cases where the same variable is used on both sides of an assignment.

### 5. Bitwise Operators
Operate on bits and perform bit-by-bit operations.

```python
a, b = 2, 3  # 2: 10 in binary, 3: 11 in binary

# Bitwise AND
print(a & b)  # Output: 2 (10 in binary)

# Bitwise OR
print(a | b)  # Output: 3 (11 in binary)

# Bitwise XOR
print(a ^ b)  # Output: 1 (01 in binary)

# Bitwise NOT
print(~a)  # Output: -3 (flips all the bits)

# Bitwise left shift
print(a << 1)  # Output: 4 (shifts left by 1 bit)

# Bitwise right shift
print(a >> 1)  # Output: 1 (shifts right by 1 bit)
```
## Details / Explaination of bitwise operation

### Bitwise Operations with `a = 2` and `b = 3`
First, understand the binary representations:
- `2` in binary is `10`.
- `3` in binary is `11`.

### 1. Bitwise AND (`&`)
The AND operation takes two bit values and returns `1` if both are `1`, else it returns `0`.

- `a & b`: `2 & 3`
- In binary: `10 & 11`
  ```
  10
  11
  ----
  10  (which is 2 in decimal)
  ```

### 2. Bitwise OR (`|`)
The OR operation takes two bit values and returns `1` if at least one of the bits is `1`.

- `a | b`: `2 | 3`
- In binary: `10 | 11`
  ```
  10
  11
  ----
  11  (which is 3 in decimal)
  ```

### 3. Bitwise XOR (`^`)
The XOR (exclusive OR) operation takes two bits and returns `1` if exactly one of the bits is `1`.

- `a ^ b`: `2 ^ 3`
- In binary: `10 ^ 11`
  ```
  10
  11
  ----
  01  (which is 1 in decimal)
  ```

### 4. Bitwise NOT (`~`)
The NOT operation inverts all the bits (turns `0` into `1`, and `1` into `0`). In Python, the result of `~a` is `-(a+1)` due to the way negative numbers are represented in binary (two's complement).

- `~a`: `~2`
- In binary: `~10` becomes `01` (in two's complement, this is `-3`)

### 5. Bitwise Left Shift (`<<`)
The left shift operation shifts all the bits to the left by a certain number of places (specified by the right operand). This is equivalent to multiplying the number by `2^n` (where `n` is the number of shifts).

- `a << 1`: `2 << 1`
- In binary: `10` shifted left by 1 place becomes `100` (which is 4 in decimal)

### 6. Bitwise Right Shift (`>>`)
The right shift operation shifts all the bits to the right by a certain number of places. This is equivalent to integer division of the number by `2^n`.

- `a >> 1`: `2 >> 1`
- In binary: `10` shifted right by 1 place becomes `1` (which is 1 in decimal)

These bitwise operations are particularly useful in low-level programming, where you need to manipulate individual bits. They're often used in areas like cryptography, graphics, network programming, and performance-critical code.

### 6. Identity Operators
Check if objects are identical (same memory location).

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
c = [1, 2, 3]

# is
print(a is b)  # Output: True

# is not
print(a is not c)  # Output: True
```

### 7. Membership Operators
Check for membership in a sequence (like strings, lists, tuples).

```python
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# in
print(3 in list)  # Output: True

# not in
print(6 not in list)  # Output: True
```
The membership operators in Python, `in` and `not in`, are broadly applicable to a variety of data types beyond just lists. They are used to test whether a value or variable is found in a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) or a collection (such as a dictionary, set, or frozenset). Here are some examples:

### 1. Lists
Check if an element exists within a list.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(3 in numbers)  # Output: True
print(6 not in numbers)  # Output: True
```

### 2. Strings
Check if a substring exists within a string.

```python
greeting = "Hello, World!"
print("World" in greeting)  # Output: True
print("Goodbye" not in greeting)  # Output: True
```

### 3. Tuples
Check if an element exists within a tuple.

```python
vowels = ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
print('e' in vowels)  # Output: True
print('y' not in vowels)  # Output: True
```

### 4. Dictionaries
Check if a key exists in a dictionary. Note that this checks keys, not values.

```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print("name" in person)  # Output: True
print("address" not in person)  # Output: True
```

### 5. Sets and Frozensets
Check if an element exists within a set or frozenset.

```python
primes = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11}
print(3 in primes)  # Output: True
print(4 not in primes)  # Output: True
```

### 6. Ranges
Check if a number exists within a certain range.

```python
nums = range(10)
print(5 in nums)  # Output: True
print(15 not in nums)  # Output: True
```

These examples demonstrate the versatility of the membership operators in Python. They are a fundamental part of Python syntax and are widely used for checking the presence or absence of an element in various data structures.
These examples cover the basic usage of the seven main categories of operators in Python, demonstrating how they are used to manipulate and evaluate data in different contexts.
