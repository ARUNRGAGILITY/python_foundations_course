# Python Part2: Collections/DataTypes: List, Tuple, Set, Dictionary and Operators

## Python List
A Python list is a versatile data structure which can hold an ordered sequence of elements. These elements can be of any type, including integers, strings, or even other lists. Lists are mutable, meaning they can be modified after creation. They are defined by enclosing elements in square brackets `[]`, and elements within a list are accessed by their index, with indexing starting at 0 for the first element.

Here's a basic example of creating and manipulating a list in Python:

```python
# Creating a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'Python', 'Django']

# Accessing elements
first_element = my_list[0]  # Access the first element (1)
last_element = my_list[-1]  # Access the last element ('Django')

# Modifying elements
my_list[1] = 'changed'  # Change the second element

# Adding elements
my_list.append('new item')  # Add a new item to the end of the list

# Removing elements
my_list.remove('Python')  # Remove the first occurrence of 'Python'

# Looping through a list
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

This code demonstrates several fundamental operations with lists, such as accessing, modifying, adding, and removing elements, as well as iterating over a list. Lists are widely used in Python due to their flexibility and ease of use.

Python lists support a variety of operations that make them extremely versatile and useful in many programming scenarios. Here are some additional operations you can perform with lists:

1. **Slicing**: Extracting a part of a list.
   ```python
   my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   slice_list = my_list[1:4]  # Returns [1, 2, 3]
   ```

2. **Concatenation**: Combining lists.
   ```python
   list_one = [1, 2, 3]
   list_two = [4, 5, 6]
   combined_list = list_one + list_two  # Returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   ```

3. **Replication**: Repeating lists.
   ```python
   my_list = [1, 2, 3]
   repeated_list = my_list * 3  # Returns [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
   ```

4. **Length**: Finding the number of items.
   ```python
   my_list = [1, 2, 3]
   length = len(my_list)  # Returns 3
   ```

5. **Sorting**: Sorting the list in place.
   ```python
   my_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]
   my_list.sort()  # The list becomes [1, 1, 3, 4, 5]
   ```

6. **Reversing**: Reversing the list in place.
   ```python
   my_list = [1, 2, 3]
   my_list.reverse()  # The list becomes [3, 2, 1]
   ```

7. **Indexing**: Finding the index of the first occurrence of an item.
   ```python
   my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'b']
   index = my_list.index('b')  # Returns 1
   ```

8. **Count**: Counting the occurrence of an item.
   ```python
   my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 4]
   count = my_list.count(2)  # Returns 3
   ```

9. **Inserting**: Insert an item at a specific position.
   ```python
   my_list = [1, 2, 4]
   my_list.insert(2, 3)  # The list becomes [1, 2, 3, 4]
   ```

10. **Popping**: Removing and returning an item at a given position.
    ```python
    my_list = [1, 2, 3]
    popped_item = my_list.pop(1)  # Removes and returns '2', list becomes [1, 3]
    ```

11. **Clearing**: Removing all items from the list.
    ```python
    my_list = [1, 2, 3]
    my_list.clear()  # The list becomes []
    ```

12. **Copying**: Creating a shallow copy of the list.
    ```python
    my_list = [1, 2, 3]
    copied_list = my_list.copy()  # copied_list is a new list with the same items
    ```

12.1 **Extending the List**: Extending the List
The `extend` method in Python is used to add all the elements of an iterable (like list, tuple, string etc.) to the end of the list. This is different from the `append` method, which adds its argument as a single element to the end of the list.

Here's an example to demonstrate how `extend` works:

```python
# Original list
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

# Another list
another_list = [4, 5, 6]

# Using extend to add elements of another_list to my_list
my_list.extend(another_list)

# Now my_list becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(my_list)
```

In this example, `extend` is used to add each element of `another_list` to `my_list`. After the operation, `my_list` contains the elements from both lists.

It's important to note that the `extend` method modifies the original list in place and doesn't return any value (it returns `None`). Also, you can use `extend` with any iterable, not just lists. For example, you can extend a list with the elements of a tuple, set, or even a string (where each character will be added as an individual element).
Each of these operations allows you to manipulate and interact with lists in different ways, making lists one of the most powerful and widely used data structures in Python.

12.2 **Unpacking Lists**: Unpacking Lists
Unpacking and working with nested lists are two important concepts in Python that can greatly enhance the flexibility and expressiveness of your code. Let's explore each of them with examples:

### Unpacking Lists
Unpacking in Python is a way to assign elements of a list (or any iterable) into variables. It's a convenient way to extract values from a list.

Here's an example:

```python
# A list with three elements
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

# Unpacking the list into variables
a, b, c = my_list

print(a)  # Output: 1
print(b)  # Output: 2
print(c)  # Output: 3
```

In this example, each element of `my_list` is assigned to a corresponding variable (`a`, `b`, `c`). The number of variables on the left side of the assignment must match the number of elements in the list.

### Nested Lists
A nested list is a list that contains other lists. It's a way to create a matrix or multi-dimensional arrays.

Here's an example:

```python
# A nested list, representing a 2x3 matrix
nested_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

# Accessing elements
print(nested_list[0])  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
print(nested_list[1][2])  # Output: 6 (third element of the second list)

# Iterating over a nested list
for inner_list in nested_list:
    for item in inner_list:
        print(item, end=' ')  # Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6
    print()
```

In this example, `nested_list` is a list containing two lists. You can access individual elements using multiple indices (like `nested_list[1][2]` for the third element of the second list). The nested loop is used to iterate over each element in this 2D list structure.

Together, these examples showcase how unpacking and nested lists can be effectively utilized in Python, offering ways to manage complex data structures and simplify variable assignments.

Lists in Python are incredibly versatile and are used in a wide range of practical scenarios. Here are some common use cases:

1. **Data Collection and Processing**: 
    - **Storing and Iterating Over Data**: Lists are often used to store collections of data, such as user inputs, records from a database, or elements parsed from a file. You can iterate over these lists to process or analyze this data.
    - **Data Analysis**: In data science, lists can be used to store and manipulate data before using more complex structures like pandas DataFrames.

2. **Implementing Stacks and Queues**:
    - **Stacks (LIFO - Last In, First Out)**: You can use lists to implement a stack. Use `append()` to push an item onto the stack and `pop()` to remove the top item.
    - **Queues (FIFO - First In, First Out)**: Although Python has a `deque` structure in the `collections` module which is more efficient for queues, lists can still be used for implementing simple queues using `append()` and `pop(0)`.

3. **Building and Managing Sequences in Algorithms**:
    - **Sorting and Searching Algorithms**: Lists are used to store data that needs to be sorted or searched through. Python provides built-in methods like `sort()` and `sorted()` for lists.
    - **Dynamic Programming**: Lists (especially 2D lists) are used to store intermediate results in dynamic programming solutions.

4. **Function Arguments and Return Values**:
    - **Passing Multiple Values**: Lists can be used to pass multiple values to a function. 
    - **Returning Multiple Values**: Functions can return lists to provide multiple output values.

5. **Web Development**:
    - **Storing and Displaying Data in Web Applications**: In web development frameworks like Django (which you are familiar with), lists are often used to pass data to templates or to handle form data.

6. **String Manipulation**:
    - **Character-by-Character Processing**: Converting strings to lists of characters is useful in scenarios where you need to do character-by-character processing.

7. **Matrix Representation**:
    - **Multidimensional Data**: Lists of lists (2D lists) are used to represent matrices or grids, which are useful in simulations, image processing, and games.

8. **Machine Learning**:
    - **Feature Representation**: In machine learning, lists are used to represent features of data samples in simpler models or algorithms.

9. **Graph Representation**:
    - **Adjacency Lists**: Lists are used to represent graphs as adjacency lists where each index in the list represents a node and the elements at that index represent the adjacent nodes.

10. **Automating Tasks**:
    - **Batch Operations**: You can use lists to store a series of tasks or commands that need to be executed in sequence.

These examples represent just a fraction of the many ways lists are used across different fields of software development and data processing. Given their flexibility and ease of use, lists are often a go-to data structure for many programming tasks.

## Practical examples of List usage
Here are three practical examples demonstrating the use of lists in Python, each catering to different applications:

### Example 1: Data Aggregation and Analysis
Imagine you're collecting temperature data over a week and need to calculate the average temperature.

```python
# List of temperatures for each day of the week
temperatures = [29, 31, 30, 32, 33, 31, 30]

# Calculating the average temperature
average_temperature = sum(temperatures) / len(temperatures)

print("Average Temperature for the Week:", average_temperature)
```

In this example, `temperatures` is a list that stores daily temperature values. The average is calculated using the `sum()` function and the `len()` function to get the total and the number of temperatures, respectively.

### Example 2: Stack Implementation (Undo Functionality)
Implementing a simple undo functionality in a text editor using a list as a stack.

```python
class TextEditor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.content = ""
        self.history = []

    def type(self, text):
        self.history.append(self.content)
        self.content += text

    def undo(self):
        if self.history:
            self.content = self.history.pop()
        else:
            print("No more actions to undo.")

# Usage
editor = TextEditor()
editor.type("Hello")
editor.type(" World")
print("Current Content:", editor.content)  # Hello World
editor.undo()
print("After Undo:", editor.content)  # Hello
```

In this example, `history` is a list used as a stack to store previous states of the text content. When the `undo` method is called, it pops the last state from the stack.

### Example 3: Batch Processing for Web Automation
Automating a batch process, like sending a series of automated messages.

```python
def send_message(recipient, message):
    print(f"Sending message to {recipient}: '{message}'")

# List of recipients
recipients = ["user1@example.com", "user2@example.com", "user3@example.com"]

# Message to be sent
message = "Hello! This is an automated notification."

# Sending the message to all recipients
for recipient in recipients:
    send_message(recipient, message)
```

Here, `recipients` is a list containing email addresses. The program iterates over this list and sends a predefined message to each recipient. This example is a basic representation of how batch processing can be handled with lists. 

These examples showcase how lists are used in data analysis, implementing basic data structures like stacks, and automating batch processes, demonstrating their versatility in different programming contexts.

### For Lists:

1. **List Comprehensions**: A concise way to create lists. It can include conditionals and nested loops.
   ```python
   squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
   ```

2. **List as a Stack or Queue**: As mentioned earlier, lists can be used as stacks with the `append()` and `pop()` methods. For queues, although lists can be used (`pop(0)`), it's more efficient to use `collections.deque`.

3. **Sorting with Custom Key**: Lists can be sorted not just in ascending or descending order, but also based on a custom key.
   ```python
   fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
   fruits.sort(key=len)  # Sort by length of the fruit name
   ```

4. **Flattening a Nested List**: Convert a list of lists into a single list.
   ```python
   nested_list = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
   flat_list = [item for sublist in nested_list for item in sublist]
   ```

5. **Copy a List**: Use `copy()` for a shallow copy or `deepcopy()` from the `copy` module for a deep copy.


### Example: Course Registration System

Consider a simple course registration system for a school or university. We'll use lists to keep track of students enrolled in different courses.

```python
class Course:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.students = []  # List to store enrolled students

    def enroll_student(self, student_name):
        self.students.append(student_name)

    def unenroll_student(self, student_name):
        if student_name in self.students:
            self.students.remove(student_name)
        else:
            print(f"Student {student_name} is not enrolled in {self.name}.")

    def display_students(self):
        print(f"Students enrolled in {self.name}:")
        for student in self.students:
            print(student)

# Usage
math_course = Course("Mathematics")
math_course.enroll_student("Alice")
math_course.enroll_student("Bob")
math_course.enroll_student("Charlie")

math_course.display_students()  # Displays students in Mathematics

math_course.unenroll_student("Bob")  # Unenroll Bob

math_course.display_students()  # Displays updated student list
```

In this example, the `Course` class has a list named `students` to store the names of enrolled students. Methods like `enroll_student` and `unenroll_student` are used to manage this list, adding and removing students as necessary. The `display_students` method is used to print all the students currently enrolled in the course.

This scenario showcases a practical application of lists in managing collections of items (in this case, students) in programs, illustrating their usefulness in scenarios like educational administration systems.


# Python Tuple

A tuple in Python is a fundamental data structure that is similar to a list, but with a key difference: tuples are immutable. This means that once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be changed, added to, or removed. Tuples are commonly used for data that shouldn't be modified and can serve as a safe way to represent fixed collections of items.

Here are some key characteristics of tuples:

1. **Immutable**: Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its elements.

2. **Ordered**: Tuples maintain the order of elements. The first element you put in the tuple stays first.

3. **Indexable**: Like lists, you can access tuple elements by their index.

4. **Iterable**: Tuples can be used in loops and comprehensions, just like lists.

5. **Support Mixed Data Types**: Tuples can contain elements of different data types, including other compound objects like lists, dictionaries, or even other tuples.

6. **Can Be Used as Keys in Dictionaries**: Unlike lists, tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are also immutable.

Tuples are defined by enclosing elements in parentheses `()`:

```python
# Creating a tuple
my_tuple = (1, "Hello", 3.14)

# Accessing elements
first_element = my_tuple[0]  # Access the first element (1)

# Tuples are immutable, so elements cannot be changed
# my_tuple[1] = "World"  # This would raise an error

# Length of a tuple
length = len(my_tuple)  # Returns 3

# Looping through a tuple
for item in my_tuple:
    print(item)
```

Tuples are particularly useful in situations where you need to ensure that data remains constant and unmodified, such as when passing information between functions that you don't want to be accidentally altered. They are also commonly used for packing and unpacking values, like when returning multiple values from a function.

Here's a rundown of various operations that can be performed with tuples in Python, along with examples for each:

1. **Creating a Tuple**: You can create a tuple by placing a sequence of elements within parentheses `()`.

   ```python
   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'Python')
   print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 'Python')
   ```

2. **Accessing Elements**: Similar to lists, you can access elements using their index.

   ```python
   element = my_tuple[2]  # Access the third element
   print(element)  # Output: 3
   ```

3. **Negative Indexing**: Access elements from the end of the tuple using negative indices.

   ```python
   last_element = my_tuple[-1]  # Last element
   print(last_element)  # Output: 'Python'
   ```

4. **Slicing**: You can slice a tuple to create a new tuple with only a subset of elements.

   ```python
   sliced_tuple = my_tuple[1:3]  # Elements from index 1 to 2
   print(sliced_tuple)  # Output: (2, 3)
   ```

5. **Concatenation**: Combine tuples using the `+` operator.

   ```python
   tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
   tuple2 = (4, 5, 6)
   combined_tuple = tuple1 + tuple2
   print(combined_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
   ```

6. **Repetition**: Repeat a tuple a specified number of times using the `*` operator.

   ```python
   repeated_tuple = tuple1 * 2
   print(repeated_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)
   ```

7. **Length of a Tuple**: Use the `len()` function to find out how many elements are in a tuple.

   ```python
   length = len(my_tuple)
   print(length)  # Output: 4
   ```

8. **Membership Testing**: Use `in` to check if an element exists in the tuple.

   ```python
   exists = 2 in my_tuple
   print(exists)  # Output: True
   ```

9. **Count**: Use the `.count()` method to count the number of times an element appears.

   ```python
   count = my_tuple.count(2)
   print(count)  # Output: 1
   ```

10. **Index**: Use the `.index()` method to find the index of the first occurrence of an element.

    ```python
    index = my_tuple.index('Python')
    print(index)  # Output: 3
    ```

11. **Unpacking**: Assign the elements of a tuple into variables.

    ```python
    t = (1, 2, 3)
    a, b, c = t
    print(a, b, c)  # Output: 1 2 3
    ```

12. **Nested Tuples**: Tuples can contain other tuples.

    ```python
    nested_tuple = (1, (2, 3), 4)
    print(nested_tuple)  # Output: (1, (2, 3), 4)
    ```

These operations demonstrate the flexibility and utility of tuples in Python. Despite their immutability, tuples are an integral part of Python programming, especially in situations where immutable sequences of data are required.

### For Tuples:

1. **Single Element Tuples**: For a single-element tuple, a comma is necessary.
   ```python
   single_tuple = (1,)  # Without the comma, it's just a number within parentheses
   ```

2. **Named Tuples**: Part of the `collections` module, named tuples allow you to create tuples with named fields.
   ```python
   from collections import namedtuple
   Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
   p = Point(1, 2)
   ```

3. **Tuple Packing and Unpacking**: Tuples can be used to swap values in a concise way.
   ```python
   a, b = 1, 2
   a, b = b, a  # Swapping values
   ```

4. **Immutable but Can Contain Mutable Objects**: While tuples themselves are immutable, they can contain mutable objects like lists.

5. **Using Tuples as Keys in Dictionaries**: Due to their immutability, tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries, which isn’t possible with lists.

6. **Tuple Assignments in Loops**: Tuples can be useful in loops for parallel assignment.
   ```python
   for a, b in [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]:
       print(a, b)
   ```



# Python Tuples Examples
Tuples in Python are often used in situations where immutability and ordered data are required. Here are some practical use cases for tuples, along with examples:

### 1. Function Arguments and Return Values
Tuples are commonly used for grouping multiple values to pass into or return from a function.

```python
def min_max(numbers):
    return min(numbers), max(numbers)

# Usage
result = min_max([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(result)  # Output: (1, 5)
```

In this example, the `min_max` function returns a tuple containing the minimum and maximum values from a list of numbers.

### 2. Immutable Data
Tuples are useful when you need to ensure that data cannot be changed.

```python
dimensions = (1920, 1080)  # Screen resolution

# Trying to change an element will raise an error
# dimensions[0] = 1024  # Uncommenting this line would raise an error
```

The `dimensions` tuple represents a screen resolution that should not change during the execution of the program.

### 3. Multiple Return Values
Functions can return multiple values as a tuple, which is a very handy feature in Python.

```python
def get_user():
    # Simulate fetching user data
    name = "Alice"
    age = 30
    return name, age  # Returning a tuple

# Usage
user_name, user_age = get_user()
print(user_name, user_age)  # Output: Alice 30
```

The `get_user` function returns both the name and age of a user as a tuple, which can be unpacked into separate variables.

### 4. Tuple Unpacking
Python allows the automatic unpacking of tuples, which can be very convenient in many scenarios.

```python
coordinates = (10, 20)

# Tuple unpacking
x, y = coordinates

print(x)  # Output: 10
print(y)  # Output: 20
```

In this example, `coordinates` is a tuple that is automatically unpacked into `x` and `y`.

### 5. Data Structures as Tuple Elements
Tuples can hold complex data structures, such as lists or other tuples, which is useful for creating nested data structures.

```python
student = ("John Doe", ["Math", "Science"], (1995, 4, 12))

name, subjects, dob = student
print(name)        # Output: John Doe
print(subjects)    # Output: ['Math', 'Science']
print(dob)         # Output: (1995, 4, 12)
```

Here, the `student` tuple contains a string, a list, and another tuple.

### 6. Named Tuples for Readable Code
Named tuples, available in the `collections` module, can be used to create tuples with named fields.

```python
from collections import namedtuple

Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
p = Point(11, y=22)

print(p.x, p.y)  # Output: 11 22
```

Named tuples make the code more readable and maintain the immutability and efficiency of regular tuples.

These examples demonstrate how tuples can be used effectively in Python for a variety of purposes, from handling function returns to managing complex data structures. Their immutability and ability to hold a fixed number of elements make them particularly useful in situations where data integrity is important.

# Python Set

A set in Python is a collection data type that is unordered, mutable, and iterable. The most notable characteristic of a set is that it is composed of unique elements: it does not allow duplicate values. This makes sets particularly useful for operations involving uniqueness and for performing mathematical set operations like unions, intersections, differences, and symmetric differences.

Here are some key properties and uses of sets in Python:

1. **Unordered**: The elements in a set do not have a defined order, and they cannot be accessed by an index or key.

2. **Mutable**: You can add or remove elements from a set after its creation.

3. **Unique Elements**: Any duplicate elements in a set are automatically removed.

4. **No Mixed Data Types**: While a set itself can contain different types of data (integers, strings, tuples, etc.), the elements must be immutable.

5. **Notable Methods**: Sets support methods like `add()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, and more.

6. **Mathematical Set Operations**: Sets support operations like union (`|`), intersection (`&`), difference (`-`), and symmetric difference (`^`).

### Creating a Set

A set is created by placing elements inside curly braces `{}`, separated by commas, or by using the `set()` function.

```python
# Creating a set with curly braces
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Creating a set from a list using set()
my_other_set = set([3, 4, 5, 6, 7])

# Sets automatically remove duplicates
my_set_with_duplicates = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4}
print(my_set_with_duplicates)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
```

### Basic Set Operations

```python
# Adding an element
my_set.add(6)  # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

# Removing an element
my_set.remove(6)  # Raises a KeyError if the element is not found

# Discarding an element (does not raise an error if the element is not found)
my_set.discard(5)  # {1, 2, 3, 4}

# Checking if an element is in a set
print(2 in my_set)  # Output: True

# Union, Intersection, Difference, and Symmetric Difference
union_set = my_set | my_other_set
intersection_set = my_set & my_other_set
difference_set = my_set - my_other_set
symmetric_difference_set = my_set ^ my_other_set
```

Sets are especially useful in situations where the uniqueness of elements is important, or when you need to efficiently perform set operations like those used in mathematics. They are also more performant than lists for certain operations, like checking if an element is present in the set.

Here are the results of the set operations performed on `my_set` and `my_other_set`:

1. **Union (`|`)**: The union of `my_set` and `my_other_set` combines all elements from both sets, without duplicates. The result is `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}`.

2. **Intersection (`&`)**: The intersection of `my_set` and `my_other_set` includes only the elements that are present in both sets. The result is `{3, 4, 5}`.

3. **Difference (`-`)**: The difference between `my_set` and `my_other_set` consists of elements that are in `my_set` but not in `my_other_set`. The result is `{1, 2}`.

4. **Symmetric Difference (`^`)**: The symmetric difference between `my_set` and `my_other_set` includes elements that are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. The result is `{1, 2, 6, 7}`.

Here's how you can define `my_set` and `my_other_set` in Python, along with an example of each set operation:

```python
# Defining the sets
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
my_other_set = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}

# Union: Combines all elements from both sets, removing duplicates
union_set = my_set | my_other_set
print("Union:", union_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}

# Intersection: Elements that are common in both sets
intersection_set = my_set & my_other_set
print("Intersection:", intersection_set)  # Output: {3, 4, 5}

# Difference: Elements in my_set but not in my_other_set
difference_set = my_set - my_other_set
print("Difference:", difference_set)  # Output: {1, 2}

# Symmetric Difference: Elements in either set, but not in both
symmetric_difference_set = my_set ^ my_other_set
print("Symmetric Difference:", symmetric_difference_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 6, 7}
```

In addition to the basic set operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference, there are several other useful operations and methods in Python that can be performed with sets. Here are some of them:

1. **Add an Element**: Use `add()` to add a single element to the set.

   ```python
   my_set = {1, 2, 3}
   my_set.add(4)
   # my_set is now {1, 2, 3, 4}
   ```

2. **Remove an Element**: Use `remove()` to remove an element from the set. This method raises a KeyError if the element is not found.

   ```python
   my_set.remove(2)
   # my_set is now {1, 3, 4}
   ```

3. **Discard an Element**: Use `discard()` to remove an element without raising an error if the element doesn't exist.

   ```python
   my_set.discard(5)  # No error if 5 is not in the set
   ```

4. **Pop an Element**: Use `pop()` to remove and return an arbitrary element from the set. This method raises a KeyError if the set is empty.

   ```python
   element = my_set.pop()
   # element is a removed item from my_set
   ```

5. **Clear the Set**: Use `clear()` to remove all elements from the set.

   ```python
   my_set.clear()
   # my_set is now an empty set {}
   ```

6. **Check Subset**: Use `issubset()` to check if a set is a subset of another set.

   ```python
   a = {1, 2}
   b = {1, 2, 3}
   is_subset = a.issubset(b)
   # is_subset is True
   ```

7. **Check Superset**: Use `issuperset()` to check if a set is a superset of another set.

   ```python
   is_superset = b.issuperset(a)
   # is_superset is True
   ```

8. **Check Disjoint Sets**: Use `isdisjoint()` to check if two sets have no elements in common.

   ```python
   c = {4, 5}
   is_disjoint = a.isdisjoint(c)
   # is_disjoint is True as a and c have no common elements
   ```

9. **Copying a Set**: Use `copy()` to create a shallow copy of the set.

   ```python
   my_set_copy = my_set.copy()
   ```

10. **Set Comprehensions**: Similar to list comprehensions, set comprehensions are a concise way to create sets.

    ```python
    squared_set = {x**2 for x in range(5)}
    # squared_set is {0, 1, 4, 9, 16}
    ```

These operations make sets a powerful and flexible tool, especially useful in scenarios where you need to handle unique elements, perform mathematical set-related operations, or simply when you require the performance benefits that sets provide due to their implementation.

# Python Set examples

Sets in Python are powerful due to their properties of being unordered collections of unique elements. Here are some practical use cases for sets, along with examples:

### 1. Removing Duplicates from a List
Sets are often used to eliminate duplicate elements from a list due to their property of containing only unique elements.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
unique_numbers = set(numbers)
print(unique_numbers)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

### 2. Membership Testing
Sets offer a highly efficient way to check whether an element is part of a collection, which is useful in scenarios like checking for prohibited words, allowed users, etc.

```python
allowed_users = {'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'}
user = 'Dave'

if user in allowed_users:
    print(f"{user} is allowed.")
else:
    print(f"{user} is not allowed.")
```

### 3. Performing Set Operations for Analysis
Sets can be used to perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, difference, which are useful in various analysis tasks.

```python
# Two sets of items
set_a = {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}
set_b = {'cherry', 'dragonfruit', 'apple'}

# Finding common items (intersection)
common = set_a & set_b
print("Common items:", common)

# Finding unique items (symmetric difference)
unique = set_a ^ set_b
print("Unique items:", unique)
```

### 4. Data Deduplication in Data Processing
Sets are used for data deduplication in data processing pipelines, where you need to process unique items.

```python
data = ["data1", "data2", "data1", "data3", "data2"]
processed_data = set(data)

for datum in processed_data:
    print(f"Processing {datum}")
```

### 5. Creating Immutable Sets
Python also offers `frozenset`, which is an immutable version of a set. This can be used as keys in a dictionary or elements of another set.

```python
immutable_set = frozenset(['apple', 'banana'])
# immutable_set.add('cherry')  # This would raise an AttributeError
```

### 6. Set Comprehensions
Set comprehensions provide a concise way to create sets. This is useful for quickly transforming and reducing data into a set.

```python
squared_set = {x**2 for x in range(10)}
print(squared_set)
```

These examples demonstrate how sets can be used in various scenarios, from simple data deduplication to complex data analysis tasks. The efficiency of sets, especially for membership tests and their ability to enforce uniqueness, makes them a valuable tool in any Python programmer's toolkit.

# Python Dictionary

A dictionary in Python is a collection data type that is unordered, mutable, and indexed. Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs, making them a highly efficient way to organize and access data. They are one of the most commonly used data structures in Python, particularly because of their flexibility and performance characteristics.

Here are some key features and uses of dictionaries:

1. **Key-Value Pairs**: Each element in a dictionary is a key-value pair. The key is used to index the value. Keys in a dictionary must be unique and immutable (like strings, numbers, or tuples).

2. **Mutable**: You can add, modify, and remove key-value pairs in a dictionary.

3. **Dynamic**: Dictionaries can grow or shrink in size as needed.

4. **Unordered**: Dictionaries in Python 3.7 and later are ordered collections, but it's best to think of them as unordered. The order of insertion is preserved, but you shouldn't rely on it in most cases.

5. **Flexible Data Types**: Both the keys and values in a dictionary can be of any data type.

6. **Efficient Lookup**: Accessing a value through its key is very fast, regardless of the size of the dictionary.

### Creating a Dictionary

You can create a dictionary by placing a comma-separated sequence of key-value pairs within curly braces `{}`, with a colon `:` separating the keys and values.

```python
# Creating a dictionary
my_dict = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 25,
    "is_student": True
}

# Accessing elements
print(my_dict["name"])  # Output: Alice

# Adding a new key-value pair
my_dict["city"] = "New York"

# Modifying an existing key-value pair
my_dict["age"] = 26

# Removing a key-value pair
del my_dict["is_student"]

# Checking if a key exists
if "city" in my_dict:
    print("City is present")

# Iterating through a dictionary
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

Dictionaries are widely used in Python for tasks like data manipulation, configuration management, and more. They provide a highly efficient way to store and retrieve data based on keys, making them an essential part of Python programming.

# Details of Python Dictionary operations
Python dictionaries are versatile, allowing for a variety of operations that make them extremely useful in many programming scenarios. Here are some common operations you can perform with dictionaries, along with examples:

### 1. Creating a Dictionary
You can create a dictionary using curly braces `{}` with key-value pairs, or by using the `dict()` constructor.

```python
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
# or
my_dict = dict(name="Alice", age=30, city="New York")
```

### 2. Accessing Values
Access values by their keys using square brackets `[]`.

```python
name = my_dict["name"]
print(name)  # Output: Alice
```

### 3. Adding and Modifying Elements
Add or modify elements by assigning a value to a key.

```python
my_dict["email"] = "alice@example.com"  # Add a new key-value pair
my_dict["age"] = 31  # Update an existing key-value pair
```

### 4. Removing Elements
Remove elements using the `del` statement, or `pop()` method.

```python
del my_dict["city"]  # Remove key "city"
age = my_dict.pop("age")  # Remove "age" and get its value
```

### 5. Checking for a Key
Check if a key exists using `in`.

```python
if "name" in my_dict:
    print("Name is present")
```

### 6. Iterating Over a Dictionary
Iterate through a dictionary using methods like `items()`, `keys()`, and `values()`.

```python
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(key, value)

for key in my_dict.keys():
    print(key)

for value in my_dict.values():
    print(value)
```

### 7. Dictionary Comprehensions
Create dictionaries using dictionary comprehensions.

```python
squared_dict = {x: x*x for x in range(6)}
```

### 8. Merging Dictionaries
Merge two dictionaries using the `update()` method or the `**` unpacking operator.

```python
other_dict = {"country": "USA", "city": "Boston"}
my_dict.update(other_dict)

# or

merged_dict = {**my_dict, **other_dict}
```

### 9. Copying a Dictionary
Make a copy using the `copy()` method or `dict()` constructor.

```python
my_dict_copy = my_dict.copy()
# or
my_dict_copy = dict(my_dict)
```

### 10. Nested Dictionaries
Dictionaries can contain other dictionaries, allowing for complex data structures.

```python
nested_dict = {"child1": {"name": "Bob", "age": 5}, "child2": {"name": "Alice", "age": 7}}
```

### 11. Getting Values Safely
Use `get()` to access values safely (without raising a KeyError).

```python
email = my_dict.get("email", "Not provided")
```

These operations demonstrate the versatility and utility of dictionaries in Python, making them a powerful tool for managing and processing data in various applications.

# Python Dictionaries Examples

Dictionaries in Python are incredibly versatile and find use in various real-world applications due to their efficiency in storing and retrieving data. Here are some practical use cases for dictionaries, along with examples:

### 1. Storing and Accessing Data
Dictionaries are ideal for storing data that can be uniquely identified by a key.

```python
# Storing user information
users = {
    "user1": {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "email": "alice@example.com"},
    "user2": {"name": "Bob", "age": 30, "email": "bob@example.com"}
}

# Accessing data
print(users["user1"]["name"])  # Output: Alice
```

### 2. Configuration Settings
Dictionaries can be used to store configuration settings where each setting is a key-value pair.

```python
config = {
    "path": "/usr/bin/",
    "max_retries": 5,
    "debug_mode": False
}

# Accessing configuration
max_retries = config["max_retries"]
```

### 3. Counting Items
Dictionaries are great for counting occurrences of items, such as words in a text.

```python
words = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "apple"]
word_count = {}

for word in words:
    if word in word_count:
        word_count[word] += 1
    else:
        word_count[word] = 1

print(word_count)  # Output: {'apple': 3, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 1}
```

### 4. Caching/Memoization
Use dictionaries to cache results of function calls to improve performance, especially for expensive computations.

```python
def factorial(n, cache={}):
    if n in cache:
        return cache[n]
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        cache[n] = n * factorial(n-1, cache)
        return cache[n]

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```

The provided `factorial` function is an example of memoization using a dictionary (`cache`). Memoization is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

Here's a detailed breakdown of how the `cache` is helping in the `factorial` function:

1. **Function Definition**:
   The function `factorial` is defined to calculate the factorial of a number `n`. It has an optional argument `cache`, which is a dictionary used to store previously computed results of the factorial function.

2. **Checking the Cache**:
   ```python
   if n in cache:
       return cache[n]
   ```
   This part checks if the factorial of `n` has already been computed and stored in `cache`. If yes, it returns the value from the cache, avoiding redundant calculations. This is where the time savings come in.

3. **Base Case**:
   ```python
   if n == 1:
       return 1
   ```
   This is the base case for the factorial function. The factorial of 1 is defined as 1.

4. **Recursive Calculation and Caching**:
   ```python
   else:
       cache[n] = n * factorial(n-1, cache)
       return cache[n]
   ```
   If the factorial of `n` is not in the cache, the function calculates it by calling itself recursively and then stores this result in `cache` before returning it. The `cache` dictionary is being passed to each recursive call. This means that any previously calculated factorial values are available to subsequent calls of the function.

5. **First Call and Subsequent Calls**:
   - When you first call `factorial(5)`, the function computes the factorial of 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1, caching each result.
   - If you call `factorial` again for any of these numbers or a number less than 5, the function will return the result directly from the cache without recomputing it.

### Example of Execution Flow:
- `factorial(5)` will calculate and store factorials of 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1.
- If you then call `factorial(3)`, it will immediately return the value from `cache` without recalculating.

### Benefit of Caching:
The primary benefit here is reducing the number of computations, especially for large numbers or multiple calls to the function. Without caching, a factorial function would perform a lot of redundant calculations, significantly slowing down for large numbers. With caching, each unique factorial is calculated only once, greatly improving performance.

### Note on Default Mutable Arguments:
Using a mutable default argument (`cache={}`) can have unintended consequences if not used carefully. In this case, it's intentional to maintain the cache between calls, but in other contexts, this behavior (where the default argument retains changes between function calls) might be surprising or undesirable.

### 5. Building a Graph
Dictionaries can represent a graph where keys are nodes and values are lists of adjacent nodes.

```python
graph = {
    "A": ["B", "C"],
    "B": ["A", "D"],
    "C": ["A", "D"],
    "D": ["B", "C"]
}

# Accessing neighbors of a node
neighbors = graph["A"]
```

### 6. JSON Data
Dictionaries are naturally suited to represent JSON objects for web development and data interchange.

```python
import json

json_data = '{"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "New York"}'
data = json.loads(json_data)  # Convert JSON to a dictionary

new_json_data = json.dumps(data)  # Convert dictionary back to JSON
```

### 7. Multi-dimensional Data
Dictionaries can store multi-dimensional data, similar to matrices or tables.

```python
# Storing data in a 2D grid format
grid = {
    (0, 0): "grass",
    (0, 1): "sand",
    (1, 0): "water",
    (1, 1): "rock"
}

terrain = grid[(1, 0)]  # Accessing the terrain at position (1, 0)
```

These examples demonstrate the flexibility and practicality of dictionaries in various scenarios, from data storage to complex data structures, highlighting their significance in Python programming.


# Python Operators

Python provides a variety of operators that can be classified into several categories. Each category serves a different purpose and operates on data in specific ways. Here are the seven types of operators in Python, explained in detail:

### 1. Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

- `+`: Addition (e.g., `a + b`)
- `-`: Subtraction (e.g., `a - b`)
- `*`: Multiplication (e.g., `a * b`)
- `/`: Division (e.g., `a / b`)
- `%`: Modulus (e.g., `a % b` returns the remainder of division)
- `**`: Exponentiation (e.g., `a ** b` is `a` raised to the power of `b`)
- `//`: Floor division (e.g., `a // b` performs division and rounds down to the nearest integer)

### 2. Comparison (Relational) Operators
Comparison operators compare values and return `True` or `False` based on the validity of the condition.

- `==`: Equal to (e.g., `a == b`)
- `!=`: Not equal to (e.g., `a != b`)
- `>`: Greater than (e.g., `a > b`)
- `<`: Less than (e.g., `a < b`)
- `>=`: Greater than or equal to (e.g., `a >= b`)
- `<=`: Less than or equal to (e.g., `a <= b`)

### 3. Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.

- `and`: Returns `True` if both statements are true (e.g., `a and b`)
- `or`: Returns `True` if one of the statements is true (e.g., `a or b`)
- `not`: Reverse the result, returns `False` if the result is true (e.g., `not a`)

### 4. Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

- `=`: Assigns a value (e.g., `a = 5`)
- `+=`: Adds and then assigns (e.g., `a += 3` is equivalent to `a = a + 3`)
- `-=`: Subtracts and then assigns (e.g., `a -= 3`)
- `*=`: Multiplies and then assigns (e.g., `a *= 3`)
- `/=`: Divides and then assigns (e.g., `a /= 3`)
- `%=`: Takes modulus and then assigns (e.g., `a %= 3`)
- `**=`: Exponentiates and then assigns (e.g., `a **= 3`)
- `//=`: Performs floor division and then assigns (e.g., `a //= 3`)
- There are more assignment operators related to bitwise operations as well.

### 5. Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators act on bits and perform bit-by-bit operations.

- `&`: Bitwise AND (e.g., `a & b`)
- `|`: Bitwise OR (e.g., `a | b`)
- `^`: Bitwise XOR (e.g., `a ^ b`)
- `~`: Bitwise NOT (e.g., `~a`)
- `<<`: Bitwise left shift (e.g., `a << 1`)
- `>>`: Bitwise right shift (e.g., `a >> 1`)

### 6. Identity Operators
Identity operators compare the memory locations of two objects.

- `is`: Returns `True` if both variables are the same object (e.g., `a is b`)
- `is not`: Returns `True` if both variables are not the same object (e.g., `a is not b`)

### 7. Membership Operators
Membership operators test if a sequence is presented in an object.

- `in`: Returns `True` if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object (e.g., `a in list`)
- `not in`: Returns `True` if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object (e.g., `a not in list`)

Each type of operator plays a crucial role in Python programming, allowing for the creation of complex expressions and the manipulation of data in various ways.
### 8. Walrus Operator
In addition to the seven main types of operators (Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical, Assignment, Bitwise, Identity, and Membership operators), Python also includes a special category known as the **Walrus Operator** as of Python 3.8. This operator is somewhat less commonly used but can be very handy in certain situations.

### Walrus Operator (`:=`)
The Walrus operator, introduced in Python 3.8, is an assignment expression operator. It assigns values to variables as part of an expression.

#### Key Features:
1. **Inline Assignments**: It allows you to assign values to variables within an expression, including conditions in loops and comprehensions.
2. **Improves Readability**: Can make some parts of the code more readable by eliminating the need for an assignment statement before the expression.
3. **Efficiency**: It can be more efficient in some cases as it avoids re-evaluating an expression.

#### Example Usage:

1. **In a While Loop**:
   ```python
   # Without Walrus Operator
   input_str = input("Enter something: ")
   while input_str != "quit":
       print("You entered:", input_str)
       input_str = input("Enter something: ")

   # With Walrus Operator
   while (input_str := input("Enter something: ")) != "quit":
       print("You entered:", input_str)
   ```

2. **In List Comprehensions**:
   ```python
   # Finding lengths of words using the Walrus operator
   words = ["hello", "world", "python", "programming"]
   lengths = [(word, len_word) for word in words if (len_word := len(word)) > 6]
   ```

In these examples, the Walrus operator `:=` allows you to assign values to variables within the expression, making the code more concise and often more readable. However, it's important to use this operator judiciously, as overuse or misuse can lead to less readable code.

# Python Operator Examples
We will go through the Operators in details

### 1. Arithmetic Operators
Perform mathematical operations.

```python
# Addition
print(5 + 3)  # Output: 8

# Subtraction
print(5 - 3)  # Output: 2

# Multiplication
print(5 * 3)  # Output: 15

# Division
print(5 / 2)  # Output: 2.5

# Modulus (remainder)
print(5 % 2)  # Output: 1

# Exponentiation
print(2 ** 3)  # Output: 8

# Floor Division
print(5 // 2)  # Output: 2
```

### 2. Comparison Operators
Compare values and return a Boolean.

```python
a, b = 5, 3

# Equal to
print(a == b)  # Output: False

# Not equal to
print(a != b)  # Output: True

# Greater than
print(a > b)  # Output: True

# Less than
print(a < b)  # Output: False

# Greater than or equal to
print(a >= b)  # Output: True

# Less than or equal to
print(a <= b)  # Output: False
```

### 3. Logical Operators
Combine conditional statements.

```python
x = True
y = False

# and
print(x and y)  # Output: False

# or
print(x or y)  # Output: True

# not
print(not x)  # Output: False
```

### 4. Assignment Operators
Assign or modify values.

```python
a = 5  # Assignment

a += 2  # Add and assign
print(a)  # Output: 7

a -= 2  # Subtract and assign
print(a)  # Output: 5

a *= 2  # Multiply and assign
print(a)  # Output: 10

a /= 2  # Divide and assign
print(a)  # Output: 5.0
```

### `%=`: Modulus and Assign
```python
a = 16
a %= 7  # Equivalent to a = a % 7
print(a)  # Output: 2
```
This calculates the remainder of `a` divided by 7 and assigns it back to `a`.

### `**=`: Exponentiate and Assign
```python
a = 2
a **= 3  # Equivalent to a = a ** 3
print(a)  # Output: 8
```
This raises `a` to the power of 3 and assigns the result back to `a`.

### `//=`: Floor Division and Assign
```python
a = 7
a //= 2  # Equivalent to a = a // 2
print(a)  # Output: 3
```
This performs floor division on `a` by 2 and assigns the result back to `a`. Floor division divides the number and rounds down to the nearest integer.

These compound assignment operators are shorthand and make the code more concise, especially in cases where the same variable is used on both sides of an assignment.

### 5. Bitwise Operators
Operate on bits and perform bit-by-bit operations.

```python
a, b = 2, 3  # 2: 10 in binary, 3: 11 in binary

# Bitwise AND
print(a & b)  # Output: 2 (10 in binary)

# Bitwise OR
print(a | b)  # Output: 3 (11 in binary)

# Bitwise XOR
print(a ^ b)  # Output: 1 (01 in binary)

# Bitwise NOT
print(~a)  # Output: -3 (flips all the bits)

# Bitwise left shift
print(a << 1)  # Output: 4 (shifts left by 1 bit)

# Bitwise right shift
print(a >> 1)  # Output: 1 (shifts right by 1 bit)
```
## Details / Explaination of bitwise operation

### Bitwise Operations with `a = 2` and `b = 3`
First, understand the binary representations:
- `2` in binary is `10`.
- `3` in binary is `11`.

### 1. Bitwise AND (`&`)
The AND operation takes two bit values and returns `1` if both are `1`, else it returns `0`.

- `a & b`: `2 & 3`
- In binary: `10 & 11`
  ```
  10
  11
  ----
  10  (which is 2 in decimal)
  ```

### 2. Bitwise OR (`|`)
The OR operation takes two bit values and returns `1` if at least one of the bits is `1`.

- `a | b`: `2 | 3`
- In binary: `10 | 11`
  ```
  10
  11
  ----
  11  (which is 3 in decimal)
  ```

### 3. Bitwise XOR (`^`)
The XOR (exclusive OR) operation takes two bits and returns `1` if exactly one of the bits is `1`.

- `a ^ b`: `2 ^ 3`
- In binary: `10 ^ 11`
  ```
  10
  11
  ----
  01  (which is 1 in decimal)
  ```

### 4. Bitwise NOT (`~`)
The NOT operation inverts all the bits (turns `0` into `1`, and `1` into `0`). In Python, the result of `~a` is `-(a+1)` due to the way negative numbers are represented in binary (two's complement).

- `~a`: `~2`
- In binary: `~10` becomes `01` (in two's complement, this is `-3`)

### 5. Bitwise Left Shift (`<<`)
The left shift operation shifts all the bits to the left by a certain number of places (specified by the right operand). This is equivalent to multiplying the number by `2^n` (where `n` is the number of shifts).

- `a << 1`: `2 << 1`
- In binary: `10` shifted left by 1 place becomes `100` (which is 4 in decimal)

### 6. Bitwise Right Shift (`>>`)
The right shift operation shifts all the bits to the right by a certain number of places. This is equivalent to integer division of the number by `2^n`.

- `a >> 1`: `2 >> 1`
- In binary: `10` shifted right by 1 place becomes `1` (which is 1 in decimal)

These bitwise operations are particularly useful in low-level programming, where you need to manipulate individual bits. They're often used in areas like cryptography, graphics, network programming, and performance-critical code.

### 6. Identity Operators
Check if objects are identical (same memory location).

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
c = [1, 2, 3]

# is
print(a is b)  # Output: True

# is not
print(a is not c)  # Output: True
```

### 7. Membership Operators
Check for membership in a sequence (like strings, lists, tuples).

```python
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# in
print(3 in list)  # Output: True

# not in
print(6 not in list)  # Output: True
```
The membership operators in Python, `in` and `not in`, are broadly applicable to a variety of data types beyond just lists. They are used to test whether a value or variable is found in a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) or a collection (such as a dictionary, set, or frozenset). Here are some examples:

### 1. Lists
Check if an element exists within a list.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(3 in numbers)  # Output: True
print(6 not in numbers)  # Output: True
```

### 2. Strings
Check if a substring exists within a string.

```python
greeting = "Hello, World!"
print("World" in greeting)  # Output: True
print("Goodbye" not in greeting)  # Output: True
```

### 3. Tuples
Check if an element exists within a tuple.

```python
vowels = ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
print('e' in vowels)  # Output: True
print('y' not in vowels)  # Output: True
```

### 4. Dictionaries
Check if a key exists in a dictionary. Note that this checks keys, not values.

```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print("name" in person)  # Output: True
print("address" not in person)  # Output: True
```

### 5. Sets and Frozensets
Check if an element exists within a set or frozenset.

```python
primes = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11}
print(3 in primes)  # Output: True
print(4 not in primes)  # Output: True
```

### 6. Ranges
Check if a number exists within a certain range.

```python
nums = range(10)
print(5 in nums)  # Output: True
print(15 not in nums)  # Output: True
```

These examples demonstrate the versatility of the membership operators in Python. They are a fundamental part of Python syntax and are widely used for checking the presence or absence of an element in various data structures.
These examples cover the basic usage of the seven main categories of operators in Python, demonstrating how they are used to manipulate and evaluate data in different contexts.
