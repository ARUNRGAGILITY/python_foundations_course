# Python Object Oriented Programming
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is widely used in Python and many other programming languages. OOP is based on the concept of "objects," which are instances of classes, and it provides a way to structure and organize code in a more modular and reusable manner. In Python, OOP is a fundamental concept, and it allows you to create and work with classes and objects. Here are the key aspects of Python Object-Oriented Programming:

### Classes and Objects

- **Class**: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data members) and methods (functions) that the objects of the class will have. In Python, a class is defined using the `class` keyword.

    ```python
    class MyClass:
        def __init__(self, attribute1, attribute2):
            self.attribute1 = attribute1
            self.attribute2 = attribute2

        def my_method(self):
            return self.attribute1 + self.attribute2
    ```

- **Object**: An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity or data structure created based on the class's blueprint. Objects have their own unique set of attributes and can invoke the methods defined in their class.

    ```python
    obj = MyClass(10, 20)
    result = obj.my_method()
    ```

### Encapsulation

- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is the principle of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It helps in hiding the internal details of how a class works and provides an interface for interacting with objects.

### Inheritance

- **Inheritance**: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reuse and the creation of a hierarchy of classes.

    ```python
    class ParentClass:
        def parent_method(self):
            print("Parent method")

    class ChildClass(ParentClass):
        def child_method(self):
            print("Child method")

    obj = ChildClass()
    obj.parent_method()  # Inherited from ParentClass
    ```

### Polymorphism

- **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables you to define methods with the same name but different implementations in different classes.

    ```python
    class Dog:
        def speak(self):
            return "Woof!"

    class Cat:
        def speak(self):
            return "Meow!"

    def animal_sound(animal):
        return animal.speak()

    dog = Dog()
    cat = Cat()
    print(animal_sound(dog))  # "Woof!"
    print(animal_sound(cat))  # "Meow!"
    ```

### Abstraction

- **Abstraction**: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on essential properties and behaviors while ignoring non-essential details. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.

### Method Overriding

- **Method Overriding**: In Python, you can override (replace) a method defined in the superclass with a new implementation in the subclass. This allows you to customize the behavior of inherited methods.

    ```python
    class ParentClass:
        def greet(self):
            return "Hello from ParentClass"

    class ChildClass(ParentClass):
        def greet(self):
            return "Hello from ChildClass"

    obj = ChildClass()
    print(obj.greet())  # "Hello from ChildClass"
    ```

Python's support for OOP makes it a versatile and powerful language for modeling real-world entities and building complex software systems. It promotes code reusability, maintainability, and modularity, making it a popular choice for a wide range of applications.

## Python OOP Examples with Vehicles 
Let's create a series of Python classes representing vehicles, including a base class `Vehicle`, and subclasses `Car`, `Bike`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. We'll cover various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

Let's create an example with the `Vehicle` class declared as an abstract class with methods and provide detailed examples of how it relates to the four Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation (APIE).

### Abstract Class: Vehicle

In this example, we'll declare the `Vehicle` class as an abstract class and define abstract methods representing key vehicle functionalities.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Vehicle(ABC):
    def __init__(self, make, model, year, color):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
        self.color = color

    @abstractmethod
    def start_engine(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def stop_engine(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def honk(self):
        pass
```

### Concrete Subclasses: Car, Bike, Bus, Truck

We'll create concrete subclasses `Car`, `Bike`, `Bus`, and `Truck` that inherit from the `Vehicle` class. Each subclass will provide implementations for the abstract methods.

```python
class Car(Vehicle):
    def start_engine(self):
        return f"{self.make} {self.model}'s engine started."

    def stop_engine(self):
        return f"{self.make} {self.model}'s engine stopped."

    def honk(self):
        return f"{self.make} {self.model} honked the horn."

class Bike(Vehicle):
    def start_engine(self):
        return f"{self.make} {self.model} doesn't have an engine."

    def stop_engine(self):
        return f"{self.make} {self.model} doesn't have an engine."

    def honk(self):
        return f"{self.make} {self.model} doesn't have a horn."

class Bus(Vehicle):
    def start_engine(self):
        return f"{self.make} {self.model}'s large engine started."

    def stop_engine(self):
        return f"{self.make} {self.model}'s large engine stopped."

    def honk(self):
        return f"{self.make} {self.model} honked its horn."

class Truck(Vehicle):
    def start_engine(self):
        return f"{self.make} {self.model}'s powerful engine started."

    def stop_engine(self):
        return f"{self.make} {self.model}'s powerful engine stopped."

    def honk(self):
        return f"{self.make} {self.model} honked its truck horn."
```

### Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation Examples

Now, let's provide examples illustrating how these OOP principles are applied:

#### Abstraction (A)

- **Abstraction**: Hides the complex implementation details.

```python
car = Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2022, "Blue")
print(car.start_engine())  # Abstraction: Start the engine of the car.
```

#### Polymorphism (P)

- **Polymorphism**: Allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

```python
vehicles = [Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2022, "Blue"), Bus("Volvo", "V70", 2020, "Yellow")]
for vehicle in vehicles:
    print(vehicle.honk())  # Polymorphism: Honk the horn (specific behavior depending on the object).
```

#### Inheritance (I)

- **Inheritance**: Subclasses inherit attributes and methods from the superclass.

```python
bus = Bus("Volvo", "V70", 2020, "Yellow")
print(bus.model)  # Inherited attribute from Vehicle: "V70"
print(bus.stop_engine())  # Inherited method from Vehicle: "Volvo V70's large engine stopped."
```

#### Encapsulation (E)

- **Encapsulation**: Keeps related data and methods together, hiding internal details.

```python
class Car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, make, model, year, color, fuel_type):
        super().__init__(make, model, year, color)
        self._fuel_type = fuel_type  # Encapsulation: Fuel type is a protected attribute.

    def get_fuel_type(self):
        return self._fuel_type

car = Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2022, "Blue", "Gasoline")
print(car.get_fuel_type())  # Encapsulation: Get the fuel type.
```

In this updated example, we've defined an abstract base class `Vehicle` with abstract methods, concrete subclasses with implementations, and demonstrated the four key OOP principles (APIE) using various examples.

## Different types of Inheritance in details

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. There are several types of inheritance, each with its own characteristics. Here are some of the common types of inheritance:

1. **Single Inheritance**:
   - In single inheritance, a class inherits from only one base class.
   - It forms a linear hierarchy.
   - Example:

   ```python
   class Animal:
       def speak(self):
           pass

   class Dog(Animal):
       def speak(self):
           return "Woof!"

   class Cat(Animal):
       def speak(self):
           return "Meow!"
   ```

2. **Multiple Inheritance**:
   - In multiple inheritance, a class can inherit from more than one base class.
   - It can lead to the diamond problem (ambiguity) if not handled properly.
   - Example:

   ```python
   class A:
       def method(self):
           return "A"

   class B:
       def method(self):
           return "B"

   class C(A, B):
       pass

   obj = C()
   print(obj.method())  # Output: "A" (Method from class A is called)
   ```

3. **Multilevel Inheritance**:
   - In multilevel inheritance, a class inherits from a base class, and then another class inherits from that derived class.
   - It forms a chain of inheritance.
   - Example:

   ```python
   class Grandparent:
       def method(self):
           return "Grandparent"

   class Parent(Grandparent):
       pass

   class Child(Parent):
       pass

   obj = Child()
   print(obj.method())  # Output: "Grandparent"
   ```

4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**:
   - In hierarchical inheritance, multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class.
   - Each derived class can have its own additional methods and attributes.
   - Example:

   ```python
   class Shape:
       def area(self):
           pass

   class Circle(Shape):
       def area(self):
           return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2

   class Rectangle(Shape):
       def area(self):
           return self.length * self.width
   ```

5. **Hybrid Inheritance**:
   - Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance.
   - It can involve single, multiple, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance in a single program.
   - Example:

   ```python
   class A:
       pass

   class B(A):
       pass

   class C(A):
       pass

   class D(B, C):
       pass
   ```

6. **Mixin Inheritance**:
   - Mixin is a special type of inheritance where a class provides methods that can be used by other classes without inheriting from it.
   - Mixins are often used for code reuse and adding functionality to classes.
   - Example:

   ```python
   class JSONMixin:
       def to_json(self):
           # Convert object to JSON format
           pass

   class Person:
       def __init__(self, name, age):
           self.name = name
           self.age = age

   class JSONPerson(Person, JSONMixin):
       pass
   ```

These are some of the common types of inheritance in OOP. The choice of which type to use depends on the design and requirements of your software application. Each type has its own advantages and considerations, and it's important to choose the one that best fits the problem you are trying to solve.
