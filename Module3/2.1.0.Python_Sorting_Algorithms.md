# Python Sorting Algorithms

A sorting algorithm is a method or process used to order the elements of a list or an array in a certain sequence. The most common sequences are numerical or lexicographical order, and these algorithms are fundamental to many operations in computer science and data processing.

In Python, sorting is a fundamental operation that's often used in various programming tasks. Python provides built-in functionalities for sorting, and you can also implement various sorting algorithms manually. Here's an overview of the key sorting techniques, especially focusing on Python:

### Python's Built-in Sorting

1. **`sorted()` Function**
   - Purpose: Returns a new sorted list from the elements of any iterable (like list, tuple, string).
   - Usage: Useful when you need a sorted version of an iterable without modifying the original one.
   - Example:
     ```python
     numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]
     sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
     ```

2. **`.sort()` Method**
   - Purpose: Sorts the elements of a list in place.
   - Usage: When you want to sort a list and don’t need to retain the original order.
   - Example:
     ```python
     numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]
     numbers.sort()
     ```

Both of these use the Timsort algorithm, an optimized hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort, and are highly efficient for real-world data.

### Common Sorting Algorithms

While Python's built-in sorting is sufficient for most applications, understanding the following algorithms is crucial for a deeper grasp of sorting concepts:

1. **Bubble Sort**
   - Simple yet inefficient for large lists.
   - Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
   - Example implementation is straightforward but not typically used in production due to inefficiency.

2. **Selection Sort**
   - Similar to bubble sort in terms of efficiency.
   - Divides the array into a sorted and an unsorted segment, repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted segment and moving it to the end of the sorted segment.

3. **Insertion Sort**
   - Efficient for small data sets and more efficient in practice than most other simple quadratic algorithms, such as selection sort or bubble sort.
   - Builds the final sorted list one item at a time.

4. **Merge Sort**
   - An efficient, stable, and comparison-based algorithm.
   - Uses the divide and conquer approach to sort the list.

5. **Quick Sort**
   - One of the most efficient sorting algorithms.
   - Also uses divide and conquer but does not require additional storage space as in merge sort.

6. **Heap Sort**
   - Based on the binary heap data structure.
   - Performs well on large data sets but can be slower in practice compared to quicksort.

7. **Counting Sort**
   - Not a comparison-based algorithm.
   - Operates by counting the number of objects having distinct key values and doing arithmetic to calculate positions.

8. **Radix Sort**
   - Non-comparative integer sorting algorithm.
   - Sorts data with integer keys by grouping keys by individual digits sharing the same significant position and value.

9. **Bucket Sort**
   - Distributes elements into buckets and then sorts these buckets individually.
   - Suitable for uniformly distributed data.

## Python Sorting Algorithms
A sorting algorithm is a method or process used to order the elements of a list or an array in a certain sequence. The most common sequences are numerical or lexicographical order, and these algorithms are fundamental to many operations in computer science and data processing.

Sorting algorithms have several important characteristics:

1. **Complexity**: This refers to the algorithm's efficiency in terms of time (how fast it sorts) and space (how much additional memory it requires). Complexity is usually expressed in Big O notation (e.g., O(n^2), O(n log n)).

2. **Stability**: A sorting algorithm is stable if it maintains the relative order of equal elements. In other words, if two items are equal according to the sorting criterion, their order relative to each other remains unchanged after sorting.

3. **In-place**: An in-place sorting algorithm rearranges the elements within the array, requiring only a constant amount of additional memory space.

4. **Comparison-based vs Non-comparison-based**: Comparison-based algorithms determine the order based on comparisons between the elements to be sorted. Non-comparison-based algorithms (like counting sort or radix sort) do not compare elements, but rather use their actual values to organize and order them.

5. **Adaptiveness**: An adaptive sorting algorithm is efficient for data that is already partially sorted.

### Common Sorting Algorithms

1. **Bubble Sort**: A simple algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

2. **Selection Sort**: Divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items already sorted, and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted sublist and moves it to the end of the sorted sublist.

3. **Insertion Sort**: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much more efficient for small data sets.

4. **Merge Sort**: An efficient, stable, divide and conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.

5. **Quick Sort**: An efficient divide and conquer algorithm. Quick sort is often faster in practice than other O(n log n) algorithms.

6. **Heap Sort**: Based on a binary heap data structure. It's similar to selection sort where the largest element is moved to the end.

7. **Counting Sort**: A non-comparison-based sorting algorithm, suitable for sorting objects according to the keys that are small integers.

8. **Radix Sort**: Also a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm. It sorts data with integer keys by grouping keys by individual digits which share the same significant position and value.

9. **Bucket Sort**: Works by distributing the elements of an array into a number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm or by recursively applying the bucket sort algorithm.

In practical applications, the choice of sorting algorithm depends on the size and nature of the data, the desired speed and efficiency, and the specific requirements of the task (like stability or memory usage). For most high-level programming tasks, such as in Python, built-in sorting functions (which are typically optimized and handle a wide variety of data types) are usually the best choice.


### When to Use Each Algorithm

- **Timsort (Python’s built-in)**: Best for general-purpose sorting in Python. It's optimized for real-world data and is stable.
- **Bubble, Selection, Insertion Sorts**: Mainly of academic interest and to teach the concepts of sorting algorithms.
- **Merge Sort**: Useful when stability is required (i.e., the order of equal elements is preserved) and there’s sufficient memory.
- **Quick Sort**: Preferred for large datasets where memory space isn't a constraint.
- **Heap Sort**: Useful when memory usage needs to be minimized (as it's in-place).
- **Counting, Radix, and Bucket Sorts**: Best for specific types of data (like integers within a certain range).

In practice, for most Python applications, the built-in sorting methods are the most efficient and easiest to use. They handle a wide variety of data types and sorting criteria, are stable, and are highly optimized. Manual implementations of sorting algorithms are mostly educational or for specific scenarios where you have unusual requirements.
### 1. Bubble Sort
- **Purpose**: A simple comparison-based algorithm where each pair of adjacent elements is compared and swapped if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.
- **Usage**: Due to its simplicity, it is often taught for educational purposes. However, it is inefficient for large lists.
- **Example**:
    ```python
    def bubble_sort(arr):
        n = len(arr)
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(0, n-i-1):
                if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                    arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]

    arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
    bubble_sort(arr)
    print("Sorted array is:", arr)
    ```

### 2. Insertion Sort
- **Purpose**: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms like quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
- **Usage**: Useful for small data sets or nearly sorted lists.
- **Example**:
    ```python
    def insertion_sort(arr):
        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            key = arr[i]
            j = i-1
            while j >=0 and key < arr[j]:
                arr[j+1] = arr[j]
                j -= 1
            arr[j+1] = key

    arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]
    insertion_sort(arr)
    print("Sorted array is:", arr)
    ```

### 3. Merge Sort
- **Purpose**: An efficient, stable, comparison-based, divide and conquer sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort.
- **Usage**: Used in various real-world applications due to its efficiency and the fact it's a stable sort (i.e., maintains the relative order of equal elements).
- **Example**:
    ```python
    def merge_sort(arr):
        if len(arr) > 1:
            mid = len(arr) // 2
            L = arr[:mid]
            R = arr[mid:]

            merge_sort(L)
            merge_sort(R)

            i = j = k = 0

            while i < len(L) and j < len(R):
                if L[i] < R[j]:
                    arr[k] = L[i]
                    i += 1
                else:
                    arr[k] = R[j]
                    j += 1
                k += 1

            while i < len(L):
                arr[k] = L[i]
                i += 1
                k += 1

            while j < len(R):
                arr[k] = R[j]
                j += 1
                k += 1

    arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]
    merge_sort(arr)
    print("Sorted array is:", arr)
    ```

### 4. Quick Sort
- **Purpose**: An efficient sorting algorithm, serving as a systematic method for placing the elements of an array in order. It's still a commonly used algorithm for sorting.
- **Usage**: Quick sort is often faster in practice than other O(n log n) algorithms. Also, quicksort can sort in-place.
- **Example**:
    ```python
    def quick_sort(arr):
        if len(arr) <= 1:
            return arr
        else:
            pivot = arr[0]
            less = [x for x in arr[1:] if x <= pivot]
            greater = [x for x in arr[1:] if x > pivot]
            return quick_sort(less) + [pivot] + quick_sort(greater)

    arr = [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]
    sorted_arr = quick_sort(arr)
    print("Sorted array is:", sorted_arr)
    ```

### 5. Heap Sort
- **Purpose**: Heapsort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on a binary heap data structure. It's similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum element and place it at the end.
- **Usage**: Used when data is stored in a binary heap; the heap's properties allow us to efficiently find the largest (or smallest) element.
- **Example**:
    ```python
    import heapq

    def heap_sort(arr):
        heapq.heapify(arr)
        return [heapq.heappop(arr) for i in range(len(arr))]

    arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6,
