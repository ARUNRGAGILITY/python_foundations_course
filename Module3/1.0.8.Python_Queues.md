# Python Queues

### What is a Queue?
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. In a queue, the element that is added first is the first one to be removed. This structure is analogous to a line of people waiting at a ticket counter: the first person in line is the first to be served.

### Key Operations
1. **Enqueue**: Add an item to the end of the queue.
2. **Dequeue**: Remove and return the item at the front of the queue.
3. **Front**: Get the item at the front of the queue without removing it.
4. **IsEmpty**: Check if the queue is empty.

### Why Use a Queue?
1. **Ordering**: Queues are used when the order of processing needs to be maintained, ensuring that the first item in is the first to be processed.
2. **Fairness**: In scenarios where resources are shared among multiple users, queues ensure a first-come-first-serve basis.
3. **Buffering**: Queues can be used as buffers in applications like printing, where tasks are queued up and processed one by one.

### Use Case Scenarios
1. **Customer Service Applications**: In call centers, incoming calls are placed in a queue and are attended to in the order they were received.
2. **Asynchronous Data Processing**: In web servers, requests are often handled using a queue, ensuring they are processed in the order of arrival.
3. **Print Queue Management**: In an office setting, print jobs are added to a queue and are executed in sequence.
4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) in Graphs and Trees**: In BFS algorithms, a queue is used to traverse the graph or tree level by level.

### 4 Examples of Queue Implementations
1. **Array-Based Queue**
   - Implemented using a fixed-size array.
   - Suitable when the maximum size of the queue is known in advance.

```python
class ArrayQueue:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.queue = [None] * capacity
        self.head = self.size = 0
        self.tail = capacity - 1
        self.capacity = capacity

    def is_full(self):
        return self.size == self.capacity

    def is_empty(self):
        return self.size == 0

    def enqueue(self, item):
        if self.is_full():
            raise Exception("Queue is full")
        self.tail = (self.tail + 1) % self.capacity
        self.queue[self.tail] = item
        self.size += 1

    def dequeue(self):
        if self.is_empty():
            raise Exception("Queue is empty")
        item = self.queue[self.head]
        self.head = (self.head + 1) % self.capacity
        self.size -= 1
        return item

    def front(self):
        if self.is_empty():
            raise Exception("Queue is empty")
        return self.queue[self.head]

# Example usage
queue = ArrayQueue(3)
queue.enqueue(1)
queue.enqueue(2)
print(queue.dequeue())  # 1
print(queue.front())    # 2
```

2. **Dynamic List Queue**
   - Uses a Python list to implement a queue with dynamic resizing.
   - More flexible as it adjusts size automatically.

```python
class ListQueue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = []

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.queue) == 0

    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.queue.append(item)

    def dequeue(self):
        if self.is_empty():
            raise Exception("Queue is empty")
        return self.queue.pop(0)

    def front(self):
        if self.is_empty():
            raise Exception("Queue is empty")
        return self.queue[0]

# Example usage
queue = ListQueue()
queue.enqueue(3)
queue.enqueue(4)
print(queue.dequeue())  # 3
print(queue.front())    # 4
```

3. **Linked List Queue**
   - Utilizes a linked list to manage the elements in the queue.
   - Efficient for operations as it doesn't require shifting elements.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedListQueue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.front = self.rear = None

    def is_empty(self):
        return self.front is None

    def enqueue(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if self.rear is None:
            self.front = self.rear = new_node
            return
        self.rear.next = new_node
        self.rear = new_node

    def dequeue(self):
        if self.is_empty():
            raise Exception("Queue is empty")
        item = self.front.data
        self.front = self.front.next
        if self.front is None:
            self.rear = None
        return
