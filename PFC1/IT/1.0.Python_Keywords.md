# Python Keywords
Keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and purposes.

### Python Indentation

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. In Python, indentation is not just for readability; it is a significant part of the syntax. It indicates a block of code, much like curly braces `{}` do in other programming languages.

#### Key Points:

1. **Blocks of Code:** A consistent indentation level defines a block of code. All statements within the block must be indented at the same level.

2. **Indentation Level:** The amount of indentation can vary, but all lines of code within the same block must be indented equally.

3. **Nested Blocks:** Nested blocks can have increased indentation levels. Each level of nesting requires its level of indentation.

4. **Good Practice:** Although you can use tabs or spaces, the recommended practice is to use four spaces per indentation level. This is the convention established in PEP 8, Python's style guide.

5. **Syntax Errors:** Incorrect indentation can lead to `IndentationError`, which is a common syntax error in Python, especially for beginners.

#### Example:

```python
def function():
    if True:
        print("True")
    else:
        print("False")
```

In this example, the print statements are part of the `if` and `else` blocks and are indented to indicate this.
