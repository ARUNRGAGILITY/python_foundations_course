# Python Conditionals
In Python, conditional statements are used to make decisions in your code. They allow your program to execute different code blocks based on whether certain conditions are met. Python supports the following conditional statements:

1. **If Statement**: The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is `True`. It can be followed by one or more `elif` (else if) statements and an optional `else` statement.

   ```python
   if condition:
       # Code to execute if the condition is True
   elif another_condition:
       # Code to execute if the first condition is False and this condition is True
   else:
       # Code to execute if none of the above conditions are True
   ```

2. **Example of an If Statement**:

   ```python
   age = 18
   if age >= 18:
       print("You are an adult.")
   else:
       print("You are not an adult.")
   ```

3. **Ternary Conditional Expression**: Python allows for a concise way of writing simple conditional expressions using the ternary operator `if-else` in a single line.

   ```python
   value_if_true if condition else value_if_false
   ```

4. **Example of a Ternary Conditional Expression**:

   ```python
   age = 20
   message = "You are an adult" if age >= 18 else "You are not an adult"
   print(message)
   ```

5. **Nested If Statements**: You can nest `if` statements within other `if`, `elif`, or `else` blocks to handle more complex conditions.

   ```python
   if condition1:
       if condition2:
           # Code to execute when both conditions are True
       else:
           # Code to execute when condition1 is True but condition2 is False
   else:
       # Code to execute when condition1 is False
   ```


These conditional statements are fundamental for controlling the flow of your Python programs based on various conditions and making your code more responsive and adaptable.

### 1. If elif else Statement with Multiple Conditions:
The `if` statement can handle multiple conditions using `elif` (else if) and `else`. In this example, we determine the grade of a student based on their score.

```python
score = 85
if score >= 90:
    grade = 'A'
elif score >= 80:
    grade = 'B'
elif score >= 70:
    grade = 'C'
else:
    grade = 'D'
print("Your grade is:", grade)
```

### 2. One more Example Ternary Conditional Expression for Pass/Fail:
Using a ternary conditional expression, we determine whether a student passed or failed based on their exam score.

```python
score = 75
result = "Pass" if score >= 60 else "Fail"
print("You", result, "the exam.")
```

### 3. Nested If Statements for Access Control:
Nested `if` statements can be used to control access to certain parts of a program. In this example, we check if a user is an admin and whether they have access to specific features.

```python
user_role = "admin"
if user_role == "admin":
    access_level = "Full Access"
else:
    if user_role == "editor":
        access_level = "Edit Access"
    else:
        access_level = "Read-Only Access"
print("Your access level is:", access_level)
```

### 4. Handling Invalid Input:
Conditional statements can be used to handle invalid input. Here, we check if a user's input is within a valid range.

```python
user_input = 15
if 1 <= user_input <= 10:
    print("Valid input.")
else:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and 10.")
```

### 5. Checking for Empty Strings:
Conditional statements can be used to check if a string is empty or not.

```python
user_input = ""
if not user_input:
    print("The string is empty.")
else:
    print("The string is not empty.")
```

These examples demonstrate various scenarios where conditional statements in Python are used to make decisions and control the flow of a program based on different conditions and requirements.

## Python match-case statement
Starting from Python 3.10, you can use the `match` statement (also known as pattern matching) to perform structured pattern matching. The `match` statement allows you to compare a value against multiple patterns and execute code based on the first matching pattern. Here's how it works:

```python
match value:
    case pattern_1:
        # Code to execute if value matches pattern_1
    case pattern_2:
        # Code to execute if value matches pattern_2
    ...
    case pattern_n:
        # Code to execute if value matches pattern_n
    case _:
        # Code to execute for the default case (optional)
```

Here are some key points about the `match` statement:

- The `match` statement compares the `value` against each `case` pattern sequentially, and the first matching pattern's associated code block is executed.

- You can have multiple `case` blocks to handle different patterns.

- You can use `_` as a wildcard pattern to match any value.

- If none of the patterns match and there's a `case _`, the code in the default case is executed.

- Patterns can include literals, variables, and more complex patterns.

Here's an example of using the `match` statement to categorize shapes based on their sides:

```python
shape = "circle"
match shape:
    case "circle":
        print("It's a circle.")
    case "triangle":
        print("It's a triangle.")
    case "square":
        print("It's a square.")
    case _:
        print("Unknown shape.")
```

In this example, the `match` statement checks the `shape` variable against different patterns to identify the type of shape.

The `match` statement is a powerful addition to Python for handling complex conditional logic and pattern-based matching in a more structured and readable way. It can be used in various scenarios to simplify code that involves multiple conditional checks.
