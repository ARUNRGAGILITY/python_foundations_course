# Python Conditionals Exerise1

Here are 10 basic exercises focusing on Python conditionals. These exercises will help you practice using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements, and get comfortable with conditional logic in Python.

### Exercise 1: Basic `if` Statement
Write a program that checks if a number stored in a variable is positive. If it is, print "Positive number."

### Exercise 2: `if-else` Statement
Modify the first program to print "Negative number" if the number is less than zero.

### Exercise 3: `elif` Statement
Extend the previous program to check if the number is zero, and print "Zero" in that case.

### Exercise 4: Multiple Conditions
Write a program that checks if a number is divisible by 2 and 3. Use `if-else` statements to print appropriate messages.

### Exercise 5: Nested `if` Statements
Write a program to check if a number is positive and even. Use a nested `if` statement.

### Exercise 6: `if-elif-else` Chain
Write a program to categorize a character into 'Uppercase', 'Lowercase', 'Digit', or 'Special character'.

### Exercise 7: Checking Membership
Write a program that uses `if` statements to check if an element exists in a list.

### Exercise 8: Using `not` with `if`
Write a program to check if a list is empty using `if not`.

### Exercise 9: Range Check
Write a program that checks if a number falls within a certain range.

### Exercise 10: Ternary Operator
Use the ternary operator to write a one-liner program that prints "Adult" if age is 18 or higher and "Minor" otherwise.

## Answers

Below are the solutions to the 10 basic exercises on Python conditionals:

### Exercise 1: Basic `if` Statement

```python
# Check if a number is positive
number = 5
if number > 0:
    print("Positive number")
```

### Exercise 2: `if-else` Statement

```python
# Check if a number is positive or negative
number = -3
if number > 0:
    print("Positive number")
else:
    print("Negative number")
```

### Exercise 3: `elif` Statement

```python
# Check if a number is positive, negative or zero
number = 0
if number > 0:
    print("Positive number")
elif number < 0:
    print("Negative number")
else:
    print("Zero")
```

### Exercise 4: Multiple Conditions

```python
# Check if a number is divisible by 2 and 3
number = 6
if number % 2 == 0 and number % 3 == 0:
    print("Divisible by 2 and 3")
else:
    print("Not divisible by 2 and 3")
```

### Exercise 5: Nested `if` Statements

```python
# Check if a number is positive and even
number = 4
if number > 0:
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print("Positive and even")
```

### Exercise 6: `if-elif-else` Chain

```python
# Categorize a character
char = 'a'
if char.isupper():
    print("Uppercase")
elif char.islower():
    print("Lowercase")
elif char.isdigit():
    print("Digit")
else:
    print("Special character")
```

### Exercise 7: Checking Membership

```python
# Check if an element exists in a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
element = 3
if element in my_list:
    print(f"{element} is in the list")
```

### Exercise 8: Using `not` with `if`

```python
# Check if a list is empty
my_list = []
if not my_list:
    print("The list is empty")
```

### Exercise 9: Range Check

```python
# Check if a number is within a certain range
number = 5
if 1 <= number <= 10:
    print("Number is in the range")
else:
    print("Number is outside the range")
```

### Exercise 10: Ternary Operator

```python
# One-liner using the ternary operator
age = 20
status = "Adult" if age >= 18 else "Minor"
print(status)
```
