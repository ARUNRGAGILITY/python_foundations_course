### Exercise 4: Loop with Condition
**Question**: Write a program that continues to loop and add numbers until the total becomes greater than 50.


### Exercise 5: Break Loop
**Question**: Write a program that breaks out of a loop when it encounters a 'stop' word.

### Exercise 6: Continue in Loop
**Question**: Write a program that skips printing numbers that are multiples of 3 in a loop from 1 to 10.


### Exercise 7: Enumerate in Loop
**Question**: Write a program that uses `enumerate` to print the index of each item in a list.


### Exercise 8: Loop through a String
