# Python Random Numbers

Generate random numbers using the `random` module. This module provides various functions for generating random numbers, including integers, floating-point numbers, and random choices from sequences. Here are some common ways to generate random numbers in Python:

1. **Generate a Random Integer:**

   ```python
   import random

   # Generate a random integer between a range (inclusive)
   random_integer = random.randint(1, 100)
   print(random_integer)
   ```

   This code will generate a random integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

2. **Generate a Random Floating-Point Number:**

   ```python
   import random

   # Generate a random floating-point number between 0 and 1
   random_float = random.random()
   print(random_float)
   ```

   This code will generate a random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).

3. **Generate a Random Floating-Point Number within a Range:**

   ```python
   import random

   # Generate a random floating-point number within a specific range
   random_range_float = random.uniform(1.0, 10.0)
   print(random_range_float)
   ```

   This code will generate a random floating-point number between 1.0 (inclusive) and 10.0 (inclusive).

4. **Generate a Random Choice from a Sequence:**

   ```python
   import random

   # Generate a random choice from a list
   choices = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
   random_choice = random.choice(choices)
   print(random_choice)
   ```

   This code will randomly select an item from the `choices` list.

5. **Shuffle a Sequence Randomly:**

   ```python
   import random

   # Shuffle a list randomly
   my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   random.shuffle(my_list)
   print(my_list)
   ```

   This code will shuffle the elements in `my_list` randomly.
