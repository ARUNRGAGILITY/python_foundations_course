# Python Conditionals Exerise1

Here are 10 basic exercises focusing on Python conditionals. These exercises will help you practice using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements, and get comfortable with conditional logic in Python.

### Exercise 1: Basic `if` Statement
Write a program that checks if a number stored in a variable is positive. If it is, print "Positive number."

### Exercise 2: `if-else` Statement
Modify the first program to print "Negative number" if the number is less than zero.

### Exercise 3: `elif` Statement
Extend the previous program to check if the number is zero, and print "Zero" in that case.

### Exercise 4: Multiple Conditions
Write a program that checks if a number is divisible by 2 and 3. Use `if-else` statements to print appropriate messages.

### Exercise 5: Nested `if` Statements
Write a program to check if a number is positive and even. Use a nested `if` statement.

### Exercise 6: `if-elif-else` Chain
Write a program to categorize a character into 'Uppercase', 'Lowercase', 'Digit', or 'Special character'.

### Exercise 7: Checking Membership
Write a program that uses `if` statements to check if an element exists in a list.

### Exercise 8: Using `not` with `if`
Write a program to check if a list is empty using `if not`.

### Exercise 9: Range Check
Write a program that checks if a number falls within a certain range.

### Exercise 10: Ternary Operator
Use the ternary operator to write a one-liner program that prints "Adult" if age is 18 or higher and "Minor" otherwise.
