# Python Loops Exercise1 Answers 

Here are 10 exercises on Python loops along with their solutions. 
These exercises cover both `for` and `while` loops, providing a good practice range for these fundamental control structures.

### Exercise 1: Loop through a List
**Question**: Write a program that loops through a list and prints each element.

**Solution**:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

### Exercise 2: Sum of a List
**Question**: Write a program to sum all the items in a list.

**Solution**:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
total = 0
for item in my_list:
    total += item
print(total)
```

### Exercise 3: Counting Pattern
**Question**: Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10 using a `while` loop.

**Solution**:
```python
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

### Exercise 4: Loop with Condition
**Question**: Write a program that continues to loop and add numbers until the total becomes greater than 50.

**Solution**:
```python
total = 0
while total <= 50:
    total += int(input("Enter a number: "))
print("Total exceeded 50:", total)
```

### Exercise 5: Break Loop
**Question**: Write a program that breaks out of a loop when it encounters a 'stop' word.

**Solution**:
```python
while True:
    word = input("Enter a word: ")
    if word == "stop":
        break
    print(word)
```

### Exercise 6: Continue in Loop
**Question**: Write a program that skips printing numbers that are multiples of 3 in a loop from 1 to 10.

**Solution**:
```python
for i in range(1, 11):
    if i % 3 == 0:
        continue
    print(i)
```

### Exercise 7: Enumerate in Loop
**Question**: Write a program that uses `enumerate` to print the index of each item in a list.

**Solution**:
```python
my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'grape']
for index, item in enumerate(my_list):
    print(index, item)
```

### Exercise 8: Loop through a String
**Question**: Write a program that loops through each character of a string and prints it.

**Solution**:
```python
my_string = "Hello"
for char in my_string:
    print(char)
```

### Exercise 9: Nested Loops
**Question**: Write a program with nested loops to create a 2x3 grid of numbers.

**Solution**:
```python
for i in range(1, 3):
    for j in range(1, 4):
        print(f"Row {i}, Column {j}")
```

### Exercise 10: Loop with Else
**Question**: Write a program with a loop that uses an `else` block to print "Loop completed" after the loop finishes.

**Solution**:
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop completed")
```
