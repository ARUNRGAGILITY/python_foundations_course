    file.write("\nThis is a new line.")
```

**Example 4: Reading Lines from a Text File**
```python
# Read and print lines from a text file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    for line in lines:
        print(line.strip())  # Remove newline characters
```

**Example 5: CSV File Writing and Reading**
```python
import csv

# Writing data to a CSV file
data = [["Name", "Age"], ["Alice", 25], ["Bob", 30]]
with open("data.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerows(data)

# Reading data from a CSV file
with open("data.csv", "r") as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
```

**Example 6: JSON File Writing and Reading**
```python
import json

# Writing data to a JSON file
data = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
with open("data.json", "w") as file:
    json.dump(data, file)

# Reading data from a JSON file
with open("data.json", "r") as file:
    loaded_data = json.load(file)
    print(loaded_data)
```

**Example 7: Binary File Writing and Reading**
```python
# Writing binary data to a binary file
binary_data = bytes([0x41, 0x42, 0x43, 0x44])
with open("binary_file.bin", "wb") as file:
    file.write(binary_data)

# Reading binary data from a binary file
with open("binary_file.bin", "rb") as file:
    read_data = file.read()

```

**Example 8: File Handling with Context Managers**
```python
# Using context managers for file handling
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
# File is automatically closed when the block is exited.
```

**Example 9: Copying Files**
```python
import shutil

# Copy a file to a new location
shutil.copy("example.txt", "example_copy.txt")
```

**Example 10: Deleting a File**

import os

# Delete a file
if os.path.exists("example_copy.txt"):
    os.remove("example_copy.txt")
```

These examples cover various file I/O operations in Python, including reading and writing text files, CSV files, JSON files, binary files, and more.


#Learn the Python File I/O

#### CSV file
```
import csv

# Exercise1: Read a CSV file and print row
with open('./data/file_io/my_data1.csv', 'r') as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f, delimiter=',')
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
        
with open('./data/file_io/my_data1.csv', 'r') as f:
    reader = csv.DictReader(f, delimiter=',')
    for row in reader:
        print(row)

```
#### my_data1.csv
```
ID,Name, LastName, Age, Occupation
1, John, Smith, 40, Engineer
2, Sara, M, 45, Doctor
```

## JSON file
```
import json
from json import JSONDecodeError, JSONEncoder

jsonString = '{"a": "apple", "b": "berry", "c": "cherry",}'
try:
    json.loads(jsonString)
except JSONDecodeError:
    print('Could not parse JSON!')
    
pythonDict = {'a': 'apple', 'b': 'berry', 'c': 'cherry',}
json.dumps(pythonDict)
```

## XML, INI, YAML file i/o

Reading and writing files in different formats like XML, INI, and YAML is a common requirement in many Python applications. Here are examples for each of these file types:

### XML File IO

Python's `xml.etree.ElementTree` module can be used for XML file processing.

#### Reading XML:

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

# Reading an XML file
tree = ET.parse('example.xml')
root = tree.getroot()

# Iterating through elements
for child in root:
    print(child.tag, child.attrib)
```

#### Writing XML:

```python
# Creating a new XML file
new_root = ET.Element("data")
item1 = ET.SubElement(new_root, "item")
item1.set("name", "item1")

# Writing to file
tree = ET.ElementTree(new_root)
tree.write("new_example.xml")
```

## more XML read/write with error handling

Here we will have XML reading, writing, searching, and printing

### Writing and Modifying an XML File with Error Handling

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

try:
    # Create the file structure
    data = ET.Element('data')
    items = ET.SubElement(data, 'items')
    item1 = ET.SubElement(items, 'item')
    item1.set('name', 'item1')
    item1.text = 'item1 description'
    item2 = ET.SubElement(items, 'item')
    item2.set('name', 'item2')
    item2.text = 'item2 description'

    # Modify the XML (e.g., adding a new item)
    item3 = ET.SubElement(items, 'item')
    item3.set('name', 'item3')
    item3.text = 'item3 description'

    # Write the modified XML to file
    tree = ET.ElementTree(data)
    with open("items.xml", "wb") as f:
        tree.write(f)

except IOError as e:
    print(f"File error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

In this code, we've added a new `item3` to the XML structure and included `try-except` blocks for basic error handling.

### Reading, Searching, and Printing from an XML File

```python
try:
    # Read the XML file
    tree = ET.parse('items.xml')
    root = tree.getroot()

    # Search for a specific item and print its details
    search_name = 'item2'
    for item in root.findall('./items/item'):
        name = item.get('name')
        if name == search_name:
            description = item.text
            print(f'Item: {name}, Description: {description}')

except ET.ParseError as e:
    print(f"XML parse error: {e}")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found. Please check the file path.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

In this snippet, we are searching for `item2` in the XML file and printing its details. The error handling covers file not found and XML parsing errors, along with a general exception catch-all.

### Note:
- Error handling in these examples is basic and is meant to illustrate the concept. In a production environment, you might want to implement more sophisticated error handling and logging.
- The search logic in the reading example is basic; depending on your needs, you might want to implement more advanced searching or filtering logic.

### INI File IO

For INI files, you can use Python's `configparser` module.

#### Reading INI:

```python
import configparser

config = configparser.ConfigParser()
config.read('example.ini')

# Accessing a specific value
value = config['DEFAULT']['SomeSetting']
print(value)
```

#### Writing INI:

```python
config['DEFAULT'] = {'SomeSetting': 'value', 'AnotherSetting': '10'}

with open('new_example.ini', 'w') as configfile:
    config.write(configfile)
```

### YAML File IO

YAML files can be handled using the `PyYAML` library, which you might need to install first using `pip install PyYAML`.

#### Reading YAML:

```python
import yaml

with open('example.yaml', 'r') as file:
    data = yaml.safe_load(file)
    print(data)
```

#### Writing YAML:

```python
data = {'key': 'value', 'list': [1, 2, 3]}

with open('new_example.yaml', 'w') as file:
    yaml.dump(data, file)
```

In these examples, replace `'example.xml'`, `'example.ini'`, and `'example.yaml'` with the paths to your own files. The reading and writing processes might need to be adjusted based on the specific structure of your files and the data you wish to manipulate. 

For the YAML examples, ensure you have PyYAML installed in your Python environment. If not, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install PyYAML
``` 

Remember, working with file IO requires appropriate error handling, especially for production code, to handle situations like missing files, parsing errors, and ensuring file access permissions.

### YAML Tutorials

### What is YAML?

YAML, which stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language" (a recursive acronym), is a human-readable data serialization format. It is commonly used for configuration files and data exchange between languages with different data structures. The format is broadly recognized for its ease of use and readability, especially in comparison to other data formats like XML or JSON.

### Features of YAML

1. **Human-Readable**: YAML's syntax is designed to be easily readable by humans. It uses indentation (spaces) to represent hierarchy, making it visually clear and straightforward.

2. **Cross-Language Support**: YAML is language-independent and can be used with any programming language that has a YAML library, such as Python, Ruby, Perl, PHP, and Java.

3. **Data Serialization**: YAML can represent scalars (like strings, integers, floats), lists (arrays), and associative arrays (dictionaries or maps).

4. **No Closing Tags**: Unlike XML, YAML doesn’t use closing tags, which reduces clutter and improves readability.

5. **Support for Complex Data Types**: YAML supports complex data types, including nested lists and dictionaries, which can be very useful for configuring complex applications.

### Why is YAML Used?

1. **Configuration Files**: Due to its readability and simplicity, YAML is often used for writing configuration files in development projects. It's particularly popular in environments like Docker, Kubernetes, and various Continuous Integration (CI) systems.

2. **Data Exchange**: YAML can be used for exchanging data between different programming environments, providing a way to serialize and share complex data structures.

3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: In modern DevOps practices, YAML is frequently used for defining and managing infrastructure, as seen in tools like Ansible, Terraform, and in Kubernetes manifests.

### Example of a YAML File

Here's a simple example to illustrate YAML’s syntax:

```yaml
# Sample YAML content
person:
  name: John Doe
  age: 30
  married: true
  children:
    - name: Jane Doe
      age: 10
    - name: Jack Doe
      age: 8
addresses:
  home:
    street: 123 Main St
    city: Anytown
  office:
    street: 456 Elm St
    city: Somewhere
```

In this example, you can see a mix of key-value pairs, lists, and nested dictionaries, showcasing how YAML can represent complex data structures in a readable format.

#### Explaination of the format
In YAML, the colon `:` and the hyphen `-` are used to define the structure and elements of the data. Understanding their usage is key to correctly interpreting and writing YAML files.

### The Colon `:` - Key-Value Pairs

In YAML, a colon `:` followed by a space is used to assign a value to a key, creating a key-value pair. This is similar to dictionaries in Python or objects in JSON. Here's how it works:

- **Syntax**: `key: value`
- **Purpose**: To define a property (key) and assign a value to it.
- **Example**:
  ```yaml
  name: John Doe
  age: 30
  ```

In this example, `name` and `age` are keys, and `John Doe` and `30` are their respective values.

### The Hyphen `-` - List Elements

The hyphen `-` is used to define elements of a list. In YAML, lists are collections of items, similar to arrays in other programming languages. Each item in a list is preceded by a hyphen and a space.

- **Syntax**: 
  ```yaml
  - item1
  - item2
  ```
- **Purpose**: To create a list where each item is a value in the list.
- **Example**:
  ```yaml
  children:
    - name: Jane Doe
      age: 10
    - name: Jack Doe
      age: 8
  ```

Here, `children` is a key, and its value is a list of items, each representing a child with their `name` and `age`. The hyphen `-` indicates the start of a new item in the list.

### Combined Example

Let's look at a combined example:

```yaml
person:
  name: John Doe
  age: 30
  children:
    - name: Jane Doe
      age: 10
    - name: Jack Doe
      age: 8
```

- `person` is a key with a dictionary as its value.
- Inside `person`, `name` and `age` are keys with `John Doe` and `30` as their respective values.
- `children` is a key whose value is a list, indicated by elements starting with `-`.
- Each item in the `children` list is a dictionary with keys `name` and `age`.

Understanding these symbols and their usage is crucial for working with YAML files, as they define the structure and relationships of the data.


### Conclusion

YAML's popularity stems from its straightforward syntax, human readability, and its ability to handle complex data structures elegantly. 
This makes it an ideal choice for configuration files, data storage, and data exchange in a variety of applications and programming environments.


## XML

### What is XML?

XML, or Extensible Markup Language, is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It is a W3C recommendation and a widely used standard for data representation and exchange.

### Primary Uses of XML

1. **Data Representation and Exchange**: XML is primarily used to store and transport data. Its platform-independent nature makes it ideal for data exchange between different systems or applications.

2. **Configuration Files**: Many software applications use XML files for configuration. These files store settings in a structured and easily accessible format.

3. **Web Development**: In web services, XML is often used for data interchange, such as in SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol).

4. **Document Formats**: Several document formats use XML, like Microsoft Office Open XML, OpenDocument, and XHTML.

5. **Data Feeds**: XML is used in RSS and Atom feeds, facilitating the syndication of web content.

### Advantages of XML

- **Self-descriptive**: XML documents are self-descriptive; the tags describe the data's meaning or structure.
- **Flexible**: Users can define their own tags, making it highly adaptable to different needs and types of data.
- **Scalable and Extensible**: It can be scaled to large systems and can be extended to accommodate new requirements.
- **Language-Neutral**: XML can be used with any programming language, enhancing interoperability.

### Examples of XML Usage

#### Example 1: Configuration File

```xml
<configuration>
  <database>
    <server>localhost</server>
    <port>3306</port>
    <username>root</username>
    <password>password</password>
  </database>
</configuration>
```

This is a simple XML example for a configuration file where database settings are stored.

#### Example 2: Data Exchange

```xml
<order>
  <customer>
    <name>John Doe</name>
    <email>john.doe@example.com</email>
  </customer>
  <items>
    <item>
      <name>Laptop</name>
      <quantity>1</quantity>
      <price>1200.00</price>
    </item>
    <item>
      <name>Mouse</name>
      <quantity>2</quantity>
      <price>25.00</price>
    </item>
  </items>
</order>
```

This XML document represents an order, including customer information and a list of items, typical in data interchange scenarios in e-commerce.

#### Example 3: Web Services

SOAP, a protocol for web services, often uses XML for its message format:

```xml
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope">
  <soap:Header>
    ...
  </soap:Header>
  <soap:Body>
    <m:GetPrice xmlns:m="http://www.example.org/stock">
      <m:StockName>IBM</m:StockName>
    </m:GetPrice>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

This example illustrates a SOAP request to get a stock price.

### Conclusion

XML is a versatile and widely-used standard for data representation and exchange. Its flexibility, scalability, and self-descriptive nature make it suitable for a variety of applications, particularly where data integrity and structured representation are crucial. Despite the rise of JSON and other data formats, XML remains a cornerstone in many systems, especially in enterprise and legacy systems.

### JSON Tutorials
### What is JSON?

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write, and for machines to parse and generate. JSON is based on a subset of JavaScript's object literal notation, although it is language-independent and can be used with many programming languages, including Python.

### Primary Uses of JSON

1. **Data Exchange**: JSON is frequently used for transmitting data between a server and a web application or between server-side applications. It's a popular format for RESTful APIs.

2. **Configuration and Settings**: Many modern applications use JSON files for configuration settings due to their straightforward and readable structure.

3. **Data Storage**: Some database systems, like MongoDB, use JSON or a variant (like BSON) for storing documents.

4. **Serialization and Deserialization**: JSON is used to serialize data structures (like objects and arrays) for network transmission or storage, and deserialize them back into usable data.

### Advantages of JSON

- **Human-Readable**: JSON structures are clear and readable by humans, making configuration and debugging more straightforward.

- **Widely Supported**: JSON is supported in almost all programming languages and environments, enhancing interoperability.

- **Lightweight**: JSON is less verbose and lighter than XML, making it ideal for network transmissions, particularly in web applications.

- **Flexible**: JSON can represent complex data structures, including nested arrays and objects.

### Examples of JSON Usage

#### Example 1: Data Exchange

```json
{
  "userId": 1,
  "id": 1,
  "title": "JSON for Beginners",
  "body": "This is a post about JSON."
}
```

This is a typical JSON object that might be sent from a server in response to an API request. It represents a blog post with various properties.

#### Example 2: Configuration File

```json
{
  "database": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "user": "root",
    "password": "password"
  },
  "server": {
    "port": 8080
  }
}
```

Here, JSON is used to store configuration settings for an application, specifying database and server parameters.

#### Example 3: Data Storage

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "isEmployed": true,
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "Anytown"
  },
  "phoneNumbers": ["123-456-7890", "987-654-3210"]
}
```

This JSON document represents a person's data, potentially stored in a NoSQL database. It includes a nested object (address) and an array of phone numbers.

### Conclusion

JSON's popularity stems from its simplicity, ease of use, and its compatibility with web technologies. It's particularly suited for web APIs and front-end/back-end communication where lightweight and easy-to-parse data formats are preferred. The format's ability to represent complex data structures in an intuitive way, along with its widespread support in programming languages and tools, makes JSON a go-to choice for many developers in data interchange scenarios.
