# Python Functions Exercise1

1. **Calculate the Area of a Circle**:
   Write a function that takes the radius of a circle as input and returns the area. Use the formula \( \pi r^2 \).

2. **Factorial of a Number**:
   Write a function to calculate the factorial of a given number. The factorial of \( n \) is \( n! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot n \).

3. **Check for Prime Number**:
   Create a function that checks whether a given number is prime or not.

4. **Reverse a String**:
   Write a function that reverses a string passed as an argument.

5. **Calculate the Fibonacci Sequence**:
   Write a function that generates the first \( n \) terms of the Fibonacci sequence.

6. **Find the Maximum of Three Numbers**:
   Create a function that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the maximum of the three.

7. **Count the Number of Vowels**:
   Write a function that counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a given string.

8. **Check for Palindrome**:
   Implement a function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

9. **Generate a List of Primes**:
   Write a function that generates a list of prime numbers up to a specified limit.

10. **Calculate the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)**:
    Implement a function to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

These exercises cover a range of concepts and will help you practice writing and using Python functions effectively.
