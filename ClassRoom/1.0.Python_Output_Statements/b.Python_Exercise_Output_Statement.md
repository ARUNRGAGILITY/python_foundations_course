# Python Output Statement Exercise

1. **Basic String Output**:
   - Print the sentence "Learning Python is fun!" to the console.
   - Modify the statement to print each word of the sentence on a new line.

2. **Formatted Output with Variables**:
   - Create two variables, `name` (a string) and `age` (an integer). Assign any values to them.
   - Use a formatted string (either with `.format()` or an f-string) to print a message like "My name is [name] and I am [age] years old."

3. **Printing a List with Custom Separator**:
   - Create a list of five fruits (e.g., `fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]`).
   - Use a `print()` statement to display the fruits separated by " - " (a hyphen and spaces).

4. **Multiline Print with Escape Sequences**:
   - Write a `print()` statement that outputs the following poem or text block using a single print statement and escape sequences for new lines and tabs:
     ```
     Roses are red,
     Violets are blue,
     Sugar is sweet,
     And so are you.
     ```
