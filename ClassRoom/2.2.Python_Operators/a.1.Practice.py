# Python Operator Practice

# Get two integers as input from the user and perform all arithmetic operations and print

# Get two strings and compare the strings and print if they are equal

# Create a list of fruits and get a fruit as input from the user and print if it exists

# Create a basic list of 10 integers and find the integer given by the user

# Create a sentence and store it, then check the user's given word is in the sentence

# Create a variable that stores 10 and then assign the variable to another variable
# check with identiy operator and explain if it says True, what it means
