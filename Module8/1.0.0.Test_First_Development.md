# Test-First Development

Test-First Development (TFD) is a software development approach where you write the test for a piece of functionality before you write the code to implement that functionality. It's closely related to Test-Driven Development (TDD), but with a subtle difference. In TDD, the focus is on writing a failing test first and then writing the minimal amount of code to pass the test, followed by refactoring. In TFD, the emphasis is more on designing and specifying what the code should do before actually writing the code itself.

### Key Concepts of Test-First Development:

1. **Write the Test First**: Before writing the functional code, you write a test that defines an expected outcome for a small piece of functionality. This test will initially fail since the functionality has not yet been implemented.

2. **Focus on Requirements**: By writing tests first, you focus on the requirements and specifications of what the code should do, which can lead to clearer and more purpose-driven coding.

3. **Incremental Development**: Development happens in small increments. For each feature or functionality, a test is written first, and then the code is developed to satisfy that test.

4. **Immediate Feedback**: Running tests immediately after writing them provides quick feedback on whether the new code meets the required specifications.

5. **Refactoring**: Once the code passes the test, it can be refactored to improve its structure, readability, or performance with confidence, knowing that the test will catch any regressions or deviations from the required behavior.

### Benefits of Test-First Development:

1. **Improved Code Quality**: Since development is driven by requirements, the code tends to be more aligned with business needs.

2. **Better Design**: Writing tests first can lead to better software design, as it requires thinking through how the code will be used before it's written.

3. **Documentation**: The tests serve as a form of documentation that describes what the code is supposed to do.

4. **Reduction in Bugs**: As tests are written before the code, it helps in identifying issues early in the development process.

5. **Facilitates Changes**: With a solid test suite, developers can make changes to the code with confidence, knowing that they will be alerted immediately if a change breaks something.

### Practical Example:

Imagine you are developing a web application using Django, and you want to add a new feature to calculate the total cost of items in a cart. In a Test-First approach, you would start by writing a test for the function responsible for this calculation.

```python
# tests.py
from django.test import TestCase
from .models import Cart

class CartTestCase(TestCase):
    def test_total_cost(self):
        cart = Cart(items=[{'name': 'Book', 'price': 10}, {'name': 'Pen', 'price': 5}])
        self.assertEqual(cart.total_cost(), 15)
```

Only after writing this test would you implement the `total_cost` method in your `Cart` model.

```python
# models.py
class Cart:
    def __init__(self, items):
        self.items = items

    def total_cost(self):
        return sum(item['price'] for item in self.items)
```

## Steps for Test First Development an Example walkthrough
Let's consider a general Python example that demonstrates the Test-First Development approach.
We'll create a simple function to calculate the factorial of a number, but we'll start by writing the test for it first.

### Step 1: Write the Test First
We'll begin by writing a test case for our factorial function. The test will check if the function correctly calculates the factorial of a given number.

```python
# test_math_functions.py
import unittest
from math_functions import factorial

class TestMathFunctions(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_factorial(self):
        self.assertEqual(factorial(5), 120)
        self.assertEqual(factorial(0), 1)
        self.assertEqual(factorial(1), 1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In this test script, we import the `unittest` module and the `factorial` function from our yet-to-be-written `math_functions.py` module. We define a class `TestMathFunctions` that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. Inside this class, we define a method `test_factorial` where we use `assertEqual` to test our expectations: the factorial of 5 should be 120, and the factorials of 0 and 1 should be 1.

### Step 2: Run the Test
If you run this test now (`python test_math_functions.py`), it will fail because the `factorial` function does not exist yet. This is part of the test-first approach â€“ you start with a failing test.

### Step 3: Implement the Functionality
Now, let's create the function that will pass this test.

```python
# math_functions.py
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

Here, we define the `factorial` function. It's a recursive function that multiplies the number by the factorial of the number minus one until it reaches the base case (factorial of 0 or 1).

### Step 4: Run the Test Again
After implementing the function, run the test again. This time, it should pass, indicating that our `factorial` function works as expected for the tested cases.

This process exemplifies the Test-First Development approach. You start by writing tests for the expected behavior, then you implement the functionality to satisfy those tests. This approach can lead to more reliable and maintainable code, 
as it ensures that you're writing code that meets its specifications from the start.

This Test-First approach ensures that you are always focusing on delivering exactly what is required, no more and no less, 
and that each piece of functionality is covered by tests from the moment it's created.
