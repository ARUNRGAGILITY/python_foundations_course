# Python 2 and 3 Differences

Python 2 and Python 3 are two major versions of the Python programming language, with Python 3 being the latest and actively maintained version. There are several key differences between these two versions:

1. **Print Statement vs. Print Function:**
   - **Python 2:** Uses `print` as a statement. Example: `print "Hello, World"`
   - **Python 3:** Uses `print` as a function. Example: `print("Hello, World")`

2. **Integer Division:**
   - **Python 2:** Dividing two integers performs integer division (truncating division). Example: `5 / 2` results in `2`.
   - **Python 3:** Dividing two integers results in a float. Example: `5 / 2` results in `2.5`. Use `//` for floor division.

3. **Unicode:**
   - **Python 2:** Strings are ASCII by default. Unicode strings are denoted with `u`, like `u"Hello"`.
   - **Python 3:** Strings are Unicode by default. Bytes are used for ASCII, like `b"Hello"`.

4. **xrange:**
   - **Python 2:** Has `range()` and `xrange()`, with `xrange()` for memory-efficient looping.
   - **Python 3:** Only `range()`, which behaves like `xrange()` from Python 2.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - **Python 2:** `except Exception, e:` syntax is used.
   - **Python 3:** `except Exception as e:` syntax is used.

6. **Iterating Over Dictionary Keys/Items:**
   - **Python 2:** Methods like `dict.keys()` return lists.
   - **Python 3:** They return "views" (dynamic view objects).

7. **Library Changes:**
   - Many standard libraries have been updated or replaced in Python 3.

8. **Syntax Changes:**
   - Python 3 has several syntax changes from Python 2 to improve the language's consistency.

9. **Input Function:**
   - **Python 2:** `raw_input()` (reads input as string) and `input()` (evaluates the input as Python code).
   - **Python 3:** Only `input()`, which reads input as a string.

10. **End of Life:**
    - **Python 2:** Officially reached its end of life on January 1, 2020. No more updates or security fixes.

11. **The 'long' Type:**
    - **Python 2:** Has `int` and `long` for integers.
    - **Python 3:** Only `int`, which behaves like `long` from Python 2.

12. **The _next_() Function and .next() Method:**
    - **Python 2:** Iterator's method is `.next()`.
    - **Python 3:** Use `next()` function.

These differences indicate Python 3's emphasis on modern features, efficiency, and reducing programming errors associated with more complex or ambiguous constructs present in Python 2. For new projects, Python 3 is strongly recommended due to its ongoing support, enhancements, and broader community adoption.
