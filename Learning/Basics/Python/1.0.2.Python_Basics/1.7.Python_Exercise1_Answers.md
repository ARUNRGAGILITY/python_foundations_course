### 1. Sum of Two Numbers
```python
# Input from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate the sum
sum_of_numbers = num1 + num2

# Print the result
print("The sum of {} and {} is: {}".format(num1, num2, sum_of_numbers))
```
Explanation:
- This program takes two numbers as input from the user using the `input` function.
- It converts the input to floating-point numbers using `float` because user input is initially treated as a string.
- The sum of the two numbers is calculated and stored in the variable `sum_of_numbers`.
- The result is printed using `print`, including the input numbers and the sum.

### 2. Greeting User
```python
# Input from the user
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")

# Greet the user
print("Hello, {}!".format(user_name))
```
Explanation:
- This program prompts the user for their name using `input`.
- It then uses string formatting to greet the user with "Hello, [name]!" where `[name]` is the user's input.

### 3. Area of Rectangle
```python
# Input from the user
length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
width = float(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))

# Calculate the area
area = length * width

# Print the result
print("The area of the rectangle is: {}".format(area))
```
Explanation:
- This program takes the length and width of a rectangle as input from the user.
- It calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying the length and width.
- The result is printed with a message.

### 4. Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion
```python
# Input from the user
celsius = float(input("Enter temperature in Celsius: "))

# Convert to Fahrenheit
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32

# Print the result
print("{} degrees Celsius is equal to {} degrees Fahrenheit".format(celsius, fahrenheit))
```
Explanation:
- This program prompts the user for a temperature in Celsius.
- It converts the temperature to Fahrenheit using the conversion formula.
- The result is printed with both Celsius and Fahrenheit values.

### 5. Simple Calculator
```python
# Input from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
operation = input("Enter an operation (+, -, *, /): ")
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Perform the calculation based on the operation
if operation == '+':
    result = num1 + num2
elif operation == '-':
    result = num1 - num2
elif operation == '*':
    result = num1 * num2
elif operation == '/':
    result = num1 / num2
else:
    result = "Invalid operation"

# Print the result
print("Result: {}".format(result))
```
Explanation:
- This program takes two numbers and an operation (+, -, *, /) as input from the user.
- It uses conditional statements to perform the corresponding calculation based on the operation chosen by the user.
- The result is printed.

### 6. Square of a Number
```python
# Input from the user
num = float(input("Enter a number: "))

# Calculate the square
square = num ** 2

# Print the result
print("The square of {} is: {}".format(num, square))
```
Explanation:
- This program takes a number as input from the user.
- It calculates the square of the number using the exponentiation operator `**`.
- The result is printed.

### 7. Kilometers to Miles Conversion
```python
# Input from the user
kilometers = float(input("Enter distance in kilometers: "))

# Convert to miles
miles = kilometers * 0.621371

# Print the result
print("{} kilometers is equal to {} miles".format(kilometers, miles))
```
Explanation:
- This program prompts the user for a distance in kilometers.
- It converts the distance to miles using the conversion factor.
- The result is printed with both kilometers and miles values.

### 8. Circumference and Area of a Circle
```python
import math

# Input from the user
radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))

# Calculate the circumference and area
circumference = 2 * math.pi * radius
area = math.pi * (radius ** 2)

# Print the results
print("Circumference of the circle: {}".format(circumference))
print("Area of the circle: {}".format(area))
```
Explanation:
- This program takes the radius of a circle as input from the user.
- It calculates both the circumference and area of the circle using the mathematical formulas.
- The results are printed.

### 9. Year of Birth
```python
# Input from the user
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Calculate the birth year
current_year = 2024
birth_year = current_year - age

# Print the birth year
print("You were born in the year: {}".format(birth_year))
```
Explanation:
- This program prompts the user for their age.
- It calculates the birth year by subtracting the age from the current year (2024).
- The birth year is printed.

### 10. Average of Three Numbers
```python
# Input from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
num3 = float(input("Enter the third number: "))

# Calculate the average
average = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3

# Print the average
print("The average of {}, {}, and {} is: {}".format(num1, num2, num3,

 average))
```
Explanation:
- This program takes three numbers as input from the user.
- It calculates the average of the three numbers by summing them and dividing by 3.
- The average is printed.

These Python programs cover various basic operations and are designed to interact with the user through input and output statements. They demonstrate fundamental concepts in Python programming.
